The technical pilot interview was the first interview conducted, and it served two purposes: to vet the equipment, and to provide a test of the methodology. After exposure to my methodology, my advocate could then use their experiences to persuade their co-workers to participate in my interview\footnote{To avoid even the appearance of conversion, my interview protocols had a opt-out step at the start of the interview. If participants withdrew consent at any time, the fiction of them having an excellent interview would still be maintained. I believe that this confidentiality step helped improved the participants' confidence and made them more willing to advocate for others' participation.}.  Due to the more public nature of this interview, as well as the work with uncertain equipment, my advocate and I chose to work with a harmless topic: our mutual participation in an online game.
