These will be reflective on the lessons I learned while creating the SDFN in contract with the prescriptive tone of the main text. }}

This section will describe the process of creating a SDFN in full. It is intended as a descriptive manual to provide readers with a way to run the methodology for themselves. In brief, the SDFN begins through the explanation of terms, a summary of the ideas expressed above. If participants do not understand the nature of entities, an entity dictionary should be created. When participants understand entity and flow, a topic is chosen and the diagram is created.
