Asking About Data
[-Some Notes on the Philosophy-]
{+Exploring Different Realities+} of Data [-and a New-] {+via the
Social Data Flow Network+} Methodology [-for Experimental Philosophy-]
By: Brian Ballsun-Stanton

3 Abstract
What is data? That question is the fundamental investigation of this dissertation. [-Inspired by Experimental Philosophy’s exploration of moral philosophy,-] I have
developed a methodology from social-scientific processes to explore how different people
understand the concept of data, rather than to rely on my own philosophical intuitions
or thought experiments about the “nature” of data. The evidence I have gathered as to
different individuals’ [-philosophies-] {+constructions+} of data can be used to inform further inquiry of data
and the design of information systems.

My research demonstrates that people have different [-philosophies-] {+constructions+} of data. The
methodology of the Social Data Flow Network, created for this dissertation, has proven
able to probe those [-philosophies.-] {+understandings.+} The Social Data Flow Network, loosely based on a
Data Flow Diagram and combined with ideas from Social Network Analysis, provides a way
of discovering practical definitions of hard-to-operationalize terms like data. The process
of repeatedly categorizing various items as data allows the methodology to explore how
participants actually use the term, rather than relying on theoretical dictionary-based
definitions.

Analysis of the interviews found three different [-philosophies-] {+constructions+} of data: data as
communications, a container for meaning; data as subjective observations, sense-impressions filtered by knowledge; and data as objective facts, measurements revealing the
relationships of reality *. [-Further research conducted through a survey also provided evidence
of these different philosophies of data.-]

*

For a longer summary of this research, look at Appendix D. The peer-reviewed paper on page [-269-] {+393+} was
presented at the IEEE 5th International Conference on Computer Sciences and Convergence Information
Technology in Seoul, Korea during the process of writing the thesis.


4 Introduction
[-While pursuing my masters, it became clear to me that no one actually knew what
information was in-]
{+In+} Information {+Systems &+} Technology [-(IT). The terms “information” and “data” are
tossed around quite often, but information technologists changed their meanings as a
function of context. Our-] {+studies (IST), I have noticed that practitioners+}
use [-of-] {+and understand+} the term [-“information” in IT is not Floridi’s information,
the intrinsic relationships of the universe [1], but a synonym for-] “data” [-with varying
degrees of communicated reliability, meta-data, and objectivity, depending on who we-] {+differently than the people they+} are [-speaking with and to what purpose.-] {+helping.+} The [-development-]
{+purpose+} of this [-jargon and the ability to then communicate with the many
disparate fields influencing the field of IT-] {+research+} is [-one of the primary reasons for the IT degree-] to [-exist, especially considering-] {+explore+} the [-lack-] {+different conceptions+} of [-theoretical underpinnings for-] {+data that may exist
beyond+} the [-field, which
exists as a mongrel offspring-] {+domain+} of [-Computer Science (CS), design, communication,-] {+IST+} and
[-psychology *. Fellow practitioners may have decent ideas of what they each mean when

using the term “data” in conversation, but there are no global, useful understandings-] {+demonstrate a methodology+} that [-I have experienced.

My primary intent is to demonstrate that people possess different-] {+workplace. By probing conceptions, the IST practitioner

[-data: people understand and use-] data [-differently because of fundamental differences-] in
[-their perceptions of what data is *.-] {+individuals.+}
This [-demonstration will provide-] {+research, however, does not propose to uncover fundamental philosophies
of data, only+} some [-grounding for a
potential new field, the study-] {+common conceptions+} of [-peoples’ philosophies-] {+data that may exist in workplaces. These

tools-] {+data can produce frustration, error,+} and [-reasons for probing the philosophy-] {+miscommunication if
people with different conceptions interact unknowingly. Conceptions+} of data [-for specific and immediate benefits:

4.1 Methodological Summary
[-I used two methodologies to probe-]
{+The primary result of this thesis is+} the [-philosophy-] {+methodology+} of [-data:-] the Social Data Flow [-Network
(SDFN) and a scenario-driven survey. Participants include researchers at BlueScope Steel,
retired intelligence analysts from a Pentagon mailing list, and my social circle. I conducted ten SDFN interviews and collected around thirty surveys.-] {+Network.+}
The [-interviews were
exclusive-] {+SDFN uses repeated categorization+} to [-researchers encountered at BlueScope Steel, though some of-] {+explore how individuals group informational
or communicative flows into categories. By eliciting categorizes that focus on data,
information, and knowledge,+} the participants
[-were visiting scholars there. The surveys explored a larger group-] {+use the categorization to operationalize
their epistemological understanding+} of [-participants from
BlueScope, intelligence analysts,-] {+data: they indicate what is+} and [-a significant population of systems-] {+is not data+} and [-database
designers drawn from my IT background.-]
{+how it becomes information and knowledge. This elicitation helps both the interviewer
and the participant to discover their own situational conceptualization of data.+}
The [-interview centered on-] {+repeated categorization allows participants to generate and resolve cognitive
dissonance situated around+} the [-iterative construction-] {+differences between their theoretical definitions+} of [-an SDFN.-] {+data
*

their de facto philosophical approaches towards knowing that something is or is not data

and their practical uses and categorizes of data.+} In {+interviews, participants demonstrated+}
a [-one-on-one
session with the participant, I established light demographic details and areas-] {+refined understanding+} of [-interest.

Using the area-] {+their own conceptions+} of [-interest to engage-] {+data at+} the [-subject as a subject-matter expert,-] {+end of+} the [-participant and I collaborated-] {+interview,
catalyzed through their participation+} in the [-construction of-] {+SDFN.

The SDFN involves+} the [-diagram, describing-] {+articulation of roles as entities, descriptions of content+}
flows between
[-people and-] {+those+} entities and [-categorizing them-] {+the categorization of those flows+} as [-to their nature: Data, Information, Knowledge,-] {+data, information,
knowledge,+} or [-Other. After the participant completed the diagram, we engaged in discussion
about-] {+other. Participants iterate over a task domain defined at+} the [-participant’s philosophy of data. Some-] {+start+} of the [-participants mentioned that-]

[-categorization helped them to unpack their philosophy.

participants’ answers about these scenarios-] and [-their commentary about their answers
collectively provided another look at-] how [-people conceptualize data.

information and/or knowledge.

A scenario based survey, inspired by+} the SDFN {+was also trialled with less satisfactory
results. While the survey did demonstrate that intelligence officers, IST professionals,+}
and {+other industrial research employees did have different conceptions of data, it did
not do so with any statistical rigor nor with the depth of discussion that the+} interviews [-using recursive analysis.-]
{+provided.+}

4.2 Results
While investigating-] {+node represents a noun. Edges on+} the [-interviews and surveys from my research, I was looking for two
very simple ideas, which I articulated as questions-] {+other hand are the relationships
or connections between nodes. An edge represents a “flow”+} of [-interest: do people-] {+action or stuff between nodes. Edges

philosophies of data, and can my methodology probe people’s philosophies of data?
For this research to serve-] {+served+} as [-a firm basis for further exploration, I have to prove that
different philosophies of data are out there. With luck, I can intuit some basis for those
philosophies. If I can demonstrate, simply, that different philosophies exist-] {+network links, roads, phone lines,+} and [-that they
profoundly inform peoples’ perceptions-] {+simple representations+} of [-data, I will count that objective successful.

I also need to prove the integrity-] {+adjacency. A
graph is a non-topological method+} of [-my methodologies, as-] {+representing+} the [-SDFN is my own creation-] {+relationships between entities through edges+} and [-the Data Flow Diagram (DFD) has not previously been used for philosophical

plural forms. While prescriptivist grammarians may wail at this shift in usage, declaring-] one [-use-] {+way flow+} of the [-word to be incorrect would invalidate this research by introducing
significant bias. Therefore, in this work, I attempt to use the term quotationdata as-] {+letter. By adding+} the [-participants saw it in each section, rather than mapping quotationdata and “datum”-] {+concept of directionality+} to [-the plural and singular respectively. Furthermore, “datum” may have-] {+edges,+} a [-completely
different meaning-] {+causal element
is introduced+} to [-some people than-] the [-singular “data,” and it would be unfair of me
to eliminate-] {+representation-specifically,+} that [-meaning from consideration.

They generally held that “data” is-] {+originating node causes+} a [-communicated, transmitted, or stored sign, usually

5.3.2 The Reality of Computing
The realms-] {+lack+} of [-computing and, to-] an [-extent, the business-]
{+explicit period+} of [-business are effectively
Baudrillardian [24] simulacra, unreal images that exist in their own locally true domains.

They are beholden in their structure and content only to themselves, rather than-] {+participants+} to
[-any underlying objectively true reality. Because protocols and contracts are human
constructions, not all people understand-] {+articulate+} their [-computing or business environment in-] {+self-schemata robs interviewers of+} the [-same way, and may attribute causes and effects to different things based on their
own knowledge.

Even our practices-]
{+potential insights+} of [-science and engineering have their-] {+an articulated schema.

A representation grid draws on the personal construct framework for its+} own [-human-created protocols, identifying matters-]
{+purposes+} of [-interest and precision simply because they use computing
technology to investigate the world. When designing computing systems for people, the
designer must understand the segment of reality constructed by and understood by the
client, rather than imposing their own understanding-] {+organizational knowledge modelling. In many ways, a “RepGrid” is a means

of [-computing onto the problem.

With the clients’ mental affordances mapped into-] {+evaluating+} a [-computer-system, the computer will both “behave”-] {+social construction of reality,+} as [-the client expects-] {+discussed by Berger+} and [-store observations in keeping with the

I [-simply do not know enough about-] {+recognize+} the [-“real” to make any kind of philosophical claims

5.1 Hierarchies of Data
This work is not+} the [-transfer-] {+first to ponder the nature+} of [-data between people-] {+data. There exist two significant and preestablished relationships+} of [-different
philosophies, I want-] {+data+} to [-understand how different people interact with data,-] {+information+} and [-how it
changes due-] {+knowledge: Ackoff’s and Tuomi’s.

My findings mostly tend+} to [-those interactions.


5.4 Conclusion
This research investigates-] {+echo+} the [-philosophy-] {+realities+} of {+data described by Ackoff or Tuomi.

While not every interview or survey articulates a hierarchical relationship between+} data, [-because there-]
{+information, and knowledge, it+} is [-no-] clear [-consensus
on-] {+that Ackoff’s work has entered+} the [-exact nature-] {+“common
knowledge”. A number+} of [-data, much less on the exact nature-] {+interviewees discussed a hierarchy+} of data [-in technical design.

However, as there is no recognized domain of the philosophy-] {+first promulgated
by Ackoff. While they never cite his influence, their descriptions+} of {+relationships between+}
data, {+information, and knowledge match his quite precisely.


Interestingly,+} this [-research, as-] {+hierarchy has+} a
[-more-] {+management basis, rather than one grounded
in philosophy or+} practical [-matter, must lay-] {+understanding of how we appreciate and use data. There
are many signs of cognitive dissonance between what is perceived as+} the [-simplest foundations for this multidisciplinary field.

My basic discoveries, both methodological-] {+traditional
hierarchy+} and [-philosophical, should have pragmatic results. I hope to create-] {+how data is used in practice. Ackoff has updated his hierarchy many
times, including+} a [-methodology that improves communication and database
design. I-] {+book “Management F-Laws” [25] wherein he+} not only [-need to demonstrate the foundations-] {+states that “to
managers, a pound+} of [-the philosophy-] {+wisdom is worth an ounce+} of [-data,-] {+understanding”+} but
[-to demonstrate-] {+also belabors the
useless metaphor with the extension+} that [-I have-] an [-X-Phi methodology capable of discovering philosophies-] {+ounce+} of
[-data.

I explore how we socially construct and use the term “data”. From this invesitgation,
I can offer potential insights into how we create trading zones between different cultures
of data use. While true understanding-] {+wisdom is worth “65,536 ounces+}
of [-the nature-] {+data.”
Tuomi presents a more philosophically rigorous conception+} of data [-may be outside the scope of
this present research,-] {+in his cyclic
hierarchy, with data feeding into information, which in turn feeds knowledge, which
provides+} the [-construction of a foundation is not. Any methodology created
must be robust enough-] {+ability+} to [-provide useful observations and a compelling story.


6 Methodology-] {+collect more data.+} In [-an effort to solicit survey responses from employees at BlueScope Steel, I gave a
presentation of my research findings there, during which I informally surveyed-] the
[-audience. “Who here thinks that data are bits?”-] {+analyses,+} I [-asked. A few raised their hands. “What
about data as hard numbers?” A few more raised their hands, with one person raising
his hand both times. “What about data-] {+will refer to this+} as [-subjective observations?” Most people raised
their hands. That same person raised his hand-] a [-third time [29].

In the audience’s response, though, I observed-] {+cyclic
hierarchy.


5.1.1 Ackoff’s Traditional Hierarchy
The traditional hierarchy linking data, information, knowledge, and wisdom in+} a [-curious phenomenon:-] {+strict
hierarchy of dominance and importance was created by Ackoff [26] in 1989. In+} a [-number-] {+summary+}
of
[-people who had expressed profoundly different philosophies-] {+his work, Bernstein notes [27]:
Ackoff was a management consultant and former professor+} of [-data-] {+management science at the Wharton School specializing+} in [-private interviews
nevertheless voted-] {+operations research
and organizational theory. His article formulating what is now commonly called the Data-Information- Knowledge-Wisdom hierarchy (or
DIKW+} for [-“data-] {+short) was first given in 1988+} as [-subjective observations” with the rest of-] {+a presidential address to+} the [-audience.-]
{+International Society for General Systems Research.+} This [-inconsistency could be attributed either to peer pressure or to-] {+background
may help explain his approach. Data in his terms are+} the [-difficulty-] {+product+} of [-theoretical definitions, but the problem is clear: it-]
{+observations, and are of no value until they are processed into a usable
form to become information. Information+} is [-difficult-] {+contained in answers+} to [-probe practical philosophies
of data without theoretical definitions or other complications creeping in.

This difficulty justifies-]
{+questions. Knowledge,+} the [-creation-] {+next layer, further refines information by
making “possible the transformation+} of [-a novel methodology. The Social Data Flow
Network (SDFN, bubble diagram) was originally constructed as part-] {+information into instructions.

It makes control+} of {+a system possible” (Ackoff, 1989, 4), and that enables
one to make it work efficiently. A managerial rather than scholarly perspective runs through Ackoff’s entire hierarchy, so that “understanding” for him connotes+} an [-earlier methodological approach. This earlier methodology had-] {+ability+} to [-face not only-] {+assess and correct for errors, while

“wisdom” means an ability to see+} the [-practical hurdle
of probing philosophies-] {+long-term consequences+} of [-data, but also-] {+any
act and evaluate them relative to+} the [-challenge-] {+ideal+} of [-probing-] {+total control (omnicompetence). While a scholarly perspective on this hierarchy might prioritize+}
the [-philosophies-] {+processes+} of
[-intelligence agents without revealing confidential or secret information. The SDFN was
intended as an adjunct-] {+inquiry and discovery, Ackoff does not account for
them. But his concept of omnicompetence, which refers to “the ability+}
to {+satisfy any and every desire” (Ackoff, 1989, 8), does encompass+} the [-central methodology-]
{+satisfaction+} of [-running people through a constructed scenario. This original methodological use was to identify small groups within
the interviewees by creating a SDFN using real flows but fictional entities. With a change
in my research population, however, the SDFN could be repurposed.

As will be discussed later, the SDFN has its methodological roots-] {+user-defined needs.


In this ontology, data are subjective observations. Curiously, despite data being
subjective observations, Ackoff does not suggest any need for filtering (a common theme+}
in {+subjective/observation conceptions of data).


5.1.2 Tuomi’s Cyclic Hierarchy
Tuomi’s ontology is simple and counter-intuitive: knowledge is a framework of+} the [-data flow

diagram (DFD).-] {+world
from which we build information.+} Information [-technologists currently use a DFD as-] {+provides+} a [-tool for probing organizational reality. I have designed-] {+local framework from which
to extract data from+} the [-SDFN as a more elegant means-] {+world. Thus, the apex+} of [-probing-] {+the hierarchy is data, which then
filters downwards to modify knowledge and information. This approach represents+} an
[-individual’s subjective reality, one unburdened by-]
{+abductive approach towards+} the [-methodological constraints-] {+philosophy+} of {+knowledge and+} the [-DFD.-] {+research about data
as the hypotheses being tested are information, generated from knowledge-of-world,
rather than induced from data points [28]:+}
The [-SDFN-] {+generally accepted view sees data as simple facts that become
information as data is combined into meaningful structures, which subsequently become knowledge as meaningful information is put into a
context and when it+} can be used {+to make predictions. This view sees
data+} as [-an artifact-] {+a prerequisite+} for [-sparking discussion around practical
definitions without the investigator having to enter the interview-] {+information,+} and [-ask participants
about their philosophy of data directly.

By allowing people to probe their own philosophy of data, the SDFN helps them
to express their own philosophies in their own language without worrying about being

judged incorrect. By creating-] {+information as+} a [-sense of cognitive dissonance * between-] {+prerequisite for knowledge. ... [Exploring]+} the [-participants’
application-] {+conceptual hierarchy+} of [-categories-] {+data,
information+} and [-their theoretical definitions, the methodology discussed-] {+knowledge, showing that data emerges only after we
have information, and that information emerges only after we already
have knowledge.


Tuomi’s conception of a reverse hierarchy is useful to my research+} in
[-this section will serve as-] {+two significant
ways. Obviously, it allows me+} a [-way-] {+prior idea+} to [-illuminate how people understand the nature-] {+which to compare analyzed hierarchies+}
of data.

[-It seems quite feasible to extend this methodology to other-] {+Although Tuomi’s+} research [-endeavors.


6.1 Literature Discussion
The SDFN did-] {+is+} not [-evolve in a vacuum. The methodological inspiration for it was the DFD
that information technologists use to design systems. However, even more than the
methodological inspirations, the practices-] {+explicitly about user’s conceptions+} of [-IT in probing reality provided proof that
the task was indeed possible.


6.1.1 Participatory Design
The process-] {+data,

The reality conflict produced by-] {+the universal domains, we are in+} a [-JAD stems from forcing all stakeholders-] {+position+} to [-articulate-] {+define

They are represented by empirical signs (i.e., signs+} that [-diagram. A Universe of Discourse (UoD) [40] is the term used for defining the topic under consideration. Everything

the [-component-] {+objective domain data are sets+} of

traditionally have served-] {+Data-I-Knowledge phenomena+} as [-network links, roads, phone lines, and simple representations-]
{+sets+} of [-adjacency. A
graph-] {+signs needs to be refined. There+} is a [-non-topological method-] {+fundamental distinction
between documented (i.e., written, spoken, or physically expressed)
propositions and meanings. “E = MC2”,“E = MC2”, and “E = MC2” are
not three different types+} of [-representing-] {+knowledge. These are three different sets
of signs that represent+} the [-relationships between entities through edges-] {+same meaning. In other words, they are
three different utterances of the same knowledge. Knowledge, in the
collective domain, is the meaning that is represented by written+} and
[-nodes.

Edges-]
{+spoken statements (i.e., sets of symbols). However, because we cannot
perceive with our senses the meaning itself, which is an abstract entity,
we+} can [-be directed: they show a flow or relationship from one node-] {+relate only+} to [-another. The direction on the

indicating-] the [-one way flow-] {+data, information, and knowledge as sets+} of {+signs
rather than as meaning and its building blocks.


My work profoundly agrees with+} the [-letter. By adding the concept-] {+discoveries he made, though my research
focuses far more on data and differentiates three different orders+} of [-directionality-] {+data+} to [-edges, a causal element-] {+his two.


5.2.2 Trading Zone
Also of interest+} is [-introduced to-] the [-representation-specifically,-] {+way+} that the [-originating node causes a relationship to the
recipient node. This addition of causality then precipitates the idea of connectiveness.

A node may or may not be reachable by other nodes. A graph or subgraph where every node can be reached
from every other node is called a strongly connected graph. A graph where that’s not true is weakly
connected. When we apply-] {+interviewees demonstrated+} the idea of [-strongly connected graphs to social networks, we can identify
small groups by identifying strongly connected subgraphs within-] a [-larger, weakly connected graph.


Interestingly, as the DFD was repurposed for business modeling, the UoD remained-] {+trading zone.

As Galison defines it [34],
These considerations so exacerbated+} the
[-same:-] {+problem [of physicists communicating] that+} it [-is still asking, “What bit-] {+seemed as if any two cultures (groups with very
different systems+} of [-reality do we care about right now?”
The DFD-] {+symbols and procedures for their manipulation)+}
would [-then-] be [-refined through a process of “zooming in” on that context

Each additional level would seek to conserve inputs and outputs, and thereby produce a

The DFD contributes great ideas-] {+do interact, most notably by trade.

Two groups can agree on rules of exchange even if they ascribe utterly
different significance+} to the [-SDFN. It contributes-] {+objects being exchanged; they may even
disagree on+} the [-idea that data is
something that can be modeled. The philosophy-] {+meaning+} of [-data embodied by-] the [-DFD is that-] {+exchange process itself. Nonetheless,+}
the
[-modeler-] {+trading partners+} can [-translate reality into data-as-bits and that data could be described through

sinks are entities outside the scope of-] {+anthropological picture is relevant here. For in focusing on local coordination,
rather than on global meaning, one can understand+} the [-diagram. By decomposing these transformations into ever simpler-] {+way engineers,

acts-] {+knowledge production. Instead of
looking at laboratories simply+} as [-translator: taking the described reality by-] the [-client-] {+places at which experimental information+} and [-forcing it into a computerized mold.

– partly symbolic and partly spatial – at which+} the [-modeler’s
translation suggests that it might be possible to use my method to probe-] {+local coordination

The DFD also contributes an iterative structure for-] {+domain I call+} the [-definition of reality.-] {+trading

The
[-iterative techniques explore the UoD in order-] {+requirement+} of [-increasing specificity from-] {+locally true definitions applies across+} the [-vague

Specifically, when+} the [-client was thinking about-] {+various participants referred to+} the [-whole task-] {+terms “raw data”+} and {+“derived

become fixated on any one aspect. With the DFD iterating across each declared “transfor-

mation” and decomposing it, the details of each transformation-] {+correspond with
their own philosophy, strictly speaking. Instead, they+} were [-both evoked and
then situated in the scaffolding of the broader context. The requirement-] {+referring+} to [-conserve
inputs and outputs eliminated any question of missing aspects-] {+various sensor
products that were, indeed, “raw data” to every member+} of the [-diagram or other

The [-idea-] {+extension+} of [-iterative exploration and definition is extremely
valuable to the SDFN.


The Social Network Graph provides-] the {+Galisonian trading zone+} concept [-of a social network *-] {+is not new+} to {+this research.

In fact, business researchers have used+} the [-SDFN.


The Social Network Graph also contributes a novel-] idea [-about the scope of edges. Edges
in the DFD were simple flows of data, representing the movement-] of [-trivial signs. In the
social network graph, edges can be individual communications, orders, relationships,-] {+trading zones+} and [-objects. The huge diversity-] {+some sophisticated

ideas+} of [-edge types suggested by a social network graph, when
combined with the DFD, ruins the DFD-] {+boundary demarcation+} for [-its original purpose: the modeling of software
systems. However, they also suggest different possible models that can be applied-] {+quite some time, going so far as+} to [-the
DFD format.


In communicative analysis, social network-] {+use+} graphs [-are used for linguistic analysis †.


It is possible-] {+and

5.2.3 Evaluative accents
An evaluative accent+} is {+the set of interpretive filters a recipient applies+} to [-confer-] {+incoming communication, thereby changing its meaning based on+} the [-ability-] {+biases applied by the recipient,
shared understanding, and cultural mores. It was originally used+} to [-identify siloing. By

{+Marxist propaganda, but+} it [-should-] {+can also+} be [-possible-] {+an interesting way+} to [-identify
strongly connected sub-graphs, which suggest communicative silos within that organization.

The social network graph contribution alters the diagramming rules-] {+explore how trading zones
operate effectively.

V. N. Voloshinov suggests an idea+} of {+an evaluative accent [36]:
Any word used in actual speech possesses not only theme and meaning
in+} the [-DFD.

Social network entities can be any actor that participates-] {+referential, or content, sense of these words, but also value judgment: i.e., all referential contents produced in living speech are said
or written+} in {+conjunction with+} a [-communication. The SDFN-] {+specific evaluative accent. There+} is [-a diagram exploring flows of data between actors, instead of flows between transformations. By creating a web-] {+no
such thing as word without evaluative accent.

What is the nature+} of [-affiliation [44] between these entities,-] {+this accent, and how does+} it [-should be possible-] {+relate+} to [-describe-] the [-communicative realities-] {+referential side of meaning? The most obvious, but at the same time, the most
superficial aspect of social value judgment incorporated in the word is+}
that [-an individual perceives. It should therefore
be possible to explore how they understand-] {+which is conveyed with+} the [-nature-] {+help+} of [-data-] {+expressive intonation. In most
cases, intonation is determined by the immediate situation and often+}
by [-exploring how they
describe-] its [-movement from entity to entity-] {+most ephemeral circumstances. To be sure, intonation of a more
substantial kind is also possible. ...

does not yet incorporate actor-network theory [45]. While Latour’s work offers many
useful ideas-] {+vehicle+} for [-understanding the world, it still imposes-]
{+intonation. The conversation was conducted in intonations expressing
the value judgments of the speakers.


Beyond the verbal intonation is context and use. In+} a [-framework from which biases
may be imparted. Therefore, while I do not-] {+more modern sense, people

of different generations+} use [-actor-network theory here, it may be
useful-] {+what amounts to steganographic * encryption+} in [-later research exploring-] {+their status

The SDFN does not try-] {+quoted material+} to [-be explanatory, comprehensive, or objective. The point-] {+produce different
meaning for different people.

An instance+} of {+this social steganography appears in+} the [-SDFN is-] {+following example to pass
different meaning through a Facebook post+} to [-reveal part of how-] the [-participant understands-] {+subject’s friends and mother:
When Carmen broke up with her boyfriend, she “wasn’t in the happiest
state.” The breakup happened while she was on+} a [-concept, not-] {+school trip and her
mother was already nervous. Initially, Carmen was going+} to [-build upon-] {+mark the
breakup with lyrics from a song+} that [-understanding nor transform it into-] {+she had been listening to, but
then she realized that the lyrics were quite depressing and worried
that if her mom read them, she’d “have+} a [-model for-] {+heart attack and think that
something is wrong.” She decided not to post the lyrics. Instead, she
posted lyrics from Monty Python’s “Always Look on the Bright Side of
Life.” This strategy was effective. Her mother wrote her+} a [-computer system. Consequently,
no design provisions-] {+note saying
that she seemed happy which made her laugh. But her closest friends
knew that this song appears+} in the [-methodology allow two or more peoples’ categories-] {+movie when the characters are about+}
to be
[-reconciled. More work will be necessary before-] {+killed. They reached out to her immediately to see how she was
really feeling.


The use of “Always Look on+} the [-SDFN can be used directly-] {+Bright Side of Life,”+} as {+Boyd discusses, is an example
of+} a [-design
methodology.


6.1.3 Intentions-] {+successful steganographic encoding+} of {+a message. Her friends could decrypt+} the [-SDFN

to be correctly anticipated by+} the [-goals-] {+recipient,+} and [-the methods-] {+this mode+} of {+receptive listening is informed by+} the [-DFD. Although-] {+evaluative accent. In more common use,+} the [-DFD implements its iterative methodology with-] {+language in+} a [-strict context

Steganography+} is [-far

Even in the social media sense, analysis comes from data created by participants for-] {+hiding messages within+} other
[-purposes: people do not designate people their “friend” on Facebook out of some desire

6.2 The Social Data Flow Network
This chapter reflects upon and explains-] {+be
parsed by+} the [-methodology created to explore-] {+listener, only+} the [-philosophy-] {+mismatch+} of [-data. The intent here is to document my activities-] {+reality models+} in [-such a way that it is possible

hint at+} the [-reader to run an SDFN from this chapter. Therefore, this theoretical discussion-] {+source+} of the [-SDFN will use-] {+problem:+} the [-second person, addressing “you”-] {+misinterpreted statement.

Voloshinov believes that+} the [-reader. Reflections on my

but also that there exist “side bands”+} of {+communication, such as intonation and body
language, that are specifically interpreted by+} the [-methodology will use-] {+recipient of any communication, in+} the [-first person and will help you-]
{+recipient’s context.

Literal intonation has very little+} to [-avoid some-] {+do with specific constructions+} of {+data. Yet+} the [-errors I made.

This section-]
{+term+} is [-organized first into definitions, an exploration-] {+used in everyday, technical, engineering, and scientific speech. The full weight+}
of the [-SDFN-] {+evaluative accent,+} as [-a
concept,-] {+seen in the interviews, falls into the use of context+} and [-then-] {+role.

While originally it was seen as way to frame ideologies; almost+} a [-practical discussion-] {+post-hermeneutic way+}
of [-running an interview centered on the SDFN.


This chapter is completed by a discussion-] {+explaining some failures+} of {+Marxism [38]. The idea of an evaluative accent can be
combined profitably with+} the [-survey methodology.


6.2.1 Terms
This section will introduce the major terms-] {+philosophy+} of the [-SDFN and how those terms are used.-] {+trading zone.+}
The [-introduction-] {+idea+} of [-a new methodology, especially one borrowing from many different
fields, is fraught-] {+an evaluative accent corresponds well+} with [-definitional dangers.

An entity is a noun: a role that can manipulate data. A flow is a noun, representing-] the [-flow-] {+idea+} of [-communication or symbols between entities. An entity dictionary is-] a [-way-] {+trading zone.

The construction+} of
[-brainstorming entities to make-] {+misunderstanding+} the [-participant feel more at ease.


6.2.1.1 Entity
An entity is something that plays a role receiving, manipulating, or transmitting data. In-] {+same language could hardly be+} the [-SDFN, this act-] {+result+} of [-input or output is represented by-]
a [-noun described in-] {+simple linguistic misunderstanding. When+} a [-few words,
which then have an oval bubble drawn around them. This bubble is-] {+data-as-subjective-observation person
says “data” to+} a [-node in graph
theory, with all of the corresponding attributes. The nature-] {+data-as-objective-hard-numbers person, both+} of [-the role is not restricted
to-] {+them are using+} a [-person or physical entity. It is anything that can be made-a-thing-of such that it
makes an independent manipulation of data.

Roles-] {+“functionally correct” definition, a definition shared by many people. They+} are [-anything-] {+encountering
a trading zone. As Galison states, “In the trading zone, where two webs meet, there
are knots, local and dense sets of quasi-rigid connections+} that can be [-conceptualized as an independent manipulator-] {+identified with
partially autonomous clusters of actions and beliefs.” [34] My identification of different
conceptions+} of
[-data. What differentiates an interesting role from one worth skipping over is whether the
role somehow transforms-] data [-passing through it. There is no restriction on-] {+certainly corresponds with these diverse beliefs. And those beliefs
inform+} the [-number
of roles that can belong to one person or thing. Just as one person can do multiple
jobs, one can also have multiple roles. One hypothesis for future testing is-] {+evaluative accents+} that [-the role
determines the perceived affordances of data. Every role has its own unique activities

39-] {+people use when they use+} and [-therefore-] {+receive the term “data.”
While different+} uses {+of+} data {+may be boundary objects for more profound cul-

tures, [39–42] this minimal investigation can scarcely provide an anthropological look
into the various research cultures+} in [-its own way. As-] {+existence. I can present research into+} the [-framing-] {+intentional
creation+} of [-the role changes, the definition-] {+a local language. The use+} of [-data may change along with it.

Participants should never describe themselves-] {+“raw” and “derived”+} as a [-singular entity due-] {+semiotic prefix presents
a linguistic indicator+} to [-ambiguity.

Their description of an entity as “self” is ambiguous-] {+switch evaluative accents+} to [-other people reading the chart,-] {+recipients+} who [-do not understand the tacit assumptions-] {+are aware+} of [-role and interaction from the same
perspective as the participant. Instead, participants should articulate the potentially
many roles-] that [-they play-]
{+indicator. The practice of forming local trading zones, by repeatedly presenting symbols
to the other party+} in an [-organization as separate entities.

Every role should be unique. However, there is no requirement for a one-to-one
mapping from person to role. Because-] {+environment where+} people [-and things-] are [-adaptable and can serve
many roles-] {+aware that bridging must occur [34], is the non-ideological practice of causing sufficient cognitive dissonance+} in [-an organization, artificially forcing-] the [-participant-]
{+recipients for them+} to [-select one and only
one definition-] {+“bud off” a new evaluative accent for interpreting the incoming
sign-set.

The evaluative accent+} of [-self would be contrary to-] the [-intent-] {+local definition+} of [-this exploration. This requirement
allows and encourages people to represent passing information to themselves-] {+a word can be understood+} in the [-guise-]
{+context+} of {+Peircian semiotics. As Aktin notes [43]:
In Peirce’s theory+} the [-different roles they play.

The avoidance of ambiguity-] {+sign relation+} is [-crucial. It makes-] {+a triadic relation that is a special
species of+} the [-SDFN easier to interpret by other
people and it forces-] {+genus:+} the [-individual creating-] {+representing relation. Whenever+} the [-diagram-] {+representing relation has an instance, we find one thing (the ‘object’) being
represented by (or: in) another thing (the ‘representamen’) and being
represented+} to [-define-] {+(or: in) a third thing (the ‘interpretant’).


The interpretant serves as+} the [-nature-] {+developed representation+} of [-the entity
explicitly. It is far too easy to use the self as a catchall-] {+meaning. Thus, we can
understand local trading zones+} to [-avoid-] {+be+} the [-cognitive dissonance-] {+product+} of [-thinking about thinking. It is important to document discrete and unambiguous roles,
even though they may map to the same person, because it is the role that understands
data, not-] {+evaluative accents present in+} the [-person. Furthermore, these different roles-as-self can pass data to one
another. I used-]
{+interpretant [44].


5.3 Justification
IST both suffers and benefits from its multidisciplinarity. One of+} the [-following example-] {+key tools taught+}

in {+IST-training programs is merely+} the [-interview: An entity as lecture designer
(myself) would pass requirements-] {+ability+} to {+understand+} the [-database lab developer (myself) who would
pass data to-] {+jargon of+} the [-lecturer (myself). Each-] {+other
sub-disciplines+} of [-those roles has different requirements for-] {+IST. As a database professional, I can still speak+} the
[-nature-] {+terminologies+} of [-data. Crucial insights would be lost if they were all collapsed into one entity
with self-pointing flows-]
{+networking, web design, and enterprise systems. The process+} of [-data.


Entities-] {+communicating in these
various jargons,+} however, [-should not be ready-to-hand *. Devices that take on independent
roles are fundamentally-] {+necessitates+} different [-from those that function as parts of another entity.

The keyboard used for typing these letters into this document should not be considered
an entity in the SDFN sense because except when engaging in this self-reflexive behavior,
the entity “author-] {+mental models+} of [-dissertation” does not explicitly pass data to the keyboard-rather,-] the [-“author-] {+world *. In addition,

each+} of [-dissertation” passes data to the computer-] {+those individual levels will have its own uses+} for [-processing.-] {+the term “data”.+} The [-keyboard-] {+field+} is [-part of-] {+not
amenable to+} a [-large entity-] {+single probe,+} and [-does not manipulate data-] {+even if it were, each sub-discipline understands reality+}
in [-my-] {+its+} own [-philosophy of data.

Instead,-] {+way,+} as [-an input device, the keyboard is an extension of the computer and represents
an interface for the electronic recording of symbols.

degree. The difficulty is in+} the [-nature-] {+question: what is data?

inform how they interact with+} the [-act-] {+constructed data+} of the [-transfer, a verb describing how the
transfer is accomplished is not particularly useful during categorization.

or more entities, although most flows link one entity to another, singular entity. There
is little objectivity in these indications-] {+and knowledge, their understanding+} of [-relationship. A flow represents a documented

5.4 Aims
I want to help improve communications, and I believe that a means for+} understanding
{+different constructions+} of

parts of conducting-] {+way to do so that has not been thoroughly

the [-nature-] {+philosophical basis+} of [-results-] {+error by offering another take on system maps transmitted
through communications †.

I will, while exploring our ability to define+} and [-in-] {+communicate data to people around
us, lay a foundation for+} the [-type-] {+exploration+} of [-thinking needed

to conduct an SDFN session, I recommend-] the [-game called “Zendo”-] {+reality created+} by [-Looney Labs *.

Specifically, if one can run multiple sessions-] {+our use+} of [-the game successfully, the same skills-] {+data+} in
[-clarifying statements and assessing the nature of things will be used-]
{+computer systems. Our systems use data+} in [-this methodology.

The core of the SDFN is-] {+multiple levels, from+} the [-process of categorization. The SDFN encourages participants to discriminate-] {+hardware+} and [-categorize flows. By relating different flows-]

The rules of Zendo-] {+methodology I create and validate+} can
be [-found here: http://www.koryheath.com/games/zendo/
The essence-] {+applied to all sorts+} of {+computerized data: from+} the [-game is that players, through the use of transparent colored pyramids, must use inductive logic to find-] {+traditional bits down+} a [-“secret rule.”
An example-] {+wire into a
simulation+} of a [-secret rule is “A [set-] {+physics experiment inside Second Life [48]. As humans use and create all+}
of [-pieces] [is true] if it has at least one green piece.” And through
rating-] {+these tools, our+} constructions of [-their own true-] {+reality inform them. To serve that end, this research
creates+} and [-false the leader of the game describes-] {+tests+} a [-universe-] {+methodology that can probe peoples’ understanding+} of [-discourse
with-] {+data.

In database design,+} the [-secret rule as-] {+hardest task is trying to understand+} the [-governing element.

The critical element of-] {+client’s reality.

Modeling a current organization’s memory structures, its files and paperwork, and+} the [-game, for purposes-]
{+relations among them in the minds+} of {+practitioners is an extremely difficult task. To
facilitate understanding,+} this [-research,-] {+methodology+} is [-that the leader of the game must, by the
rules, refine ambiguity from any guesses the players-] {+a tool for designers. The tool+} may [-make. “Clarify the Guess: If the Master does not
fully-] {+allow
them to+} understand [-your guess, or if it is ambiguous in some way,-] {+what their clients think data actually is.

By understanding+} the [-Master will ask clarifying questions
until-] {+type of data being modeled, database designers make two
significant gains. First, their data models can correspond with how their clients think
about reality, and thereby create intuitive relationships and map+} the [-uncertainty has been resolved. Your guess is not considered-] {+computerized model+}
to [-be official until both you-] {+their client’s mental model more capably. Second,+} and {+in some ways more critically,
they can then explain+} the

In+} the [-table contradicts your guess,-] {+same way,+} the [-Master-] {+proposed methodology+} should
[-point this out, and you may take back your stone or change your guess. It is-] {+help extend normal modeling
practice: simply making designers more aware of+} the [-Master’s responsibility
to-] {+different types of data constructions

are encouraged to participate in this process.”-] {+more responsive designs possible.+} The [-process-] {+demonstration+} of [-clarifying guesses to eliminate ambiguity-] {+different conceptions

captured and incorporated.

I also want to create+} a [-fun game,-] {+method that can help extend HCI design practice. This

designers can understand how+} to [-this list. For example,-] {+render data presented+} in [-the interviews, I always prompted participants
with “Data, Information, Knowledge, or Other.”
There should always be the option for Other. But the Other category should never
remain as Other; the participant should name it. Some participants used categories such-] {+an interface. A tool that can
make elements of private jargon explicit, and that is focused on that task (rather than
treating it+} as [-Emotion, Wisdom, or Request. In no case was-] a [-flow allowed-] {+happy byproduct) can significantly contribute+} to [-remain Other. These
new categories were created on-] the [-fly and used as part-] {+HCI design cycle.

This research investigates individual constructions+} of [-that participant’s diagram
from then on.

At the same time, people should not classify their own domains without any initial
guidance. All but the most self-reflective will be paralyzed by the many choices available
and not entirely-] {+data, because there is no+}
clear {+consensus+} on the [-distinctions the interviewer wants them to draw. Thus, my
question took-] {+exact nature of data, much less on+} the [-form-] {+exact nature+} of [-“Data, Information, Knowledge, or Other” rather than “How
would you categorize this flow:-] data [-or not-data?” Denoting sample categories creates a
negotiable universe-] {+in
technical design. However, as there is no recognized domain+} of [-discourse for-] the [-categories.

If-] {+philosophy of data,
this research, as+} a [-diagram becomes too crowded, it is quite acceptable to make “wormholes” on
the paper design during the interview. A wormhole is some symbol (usually an *) and

an identifier should be considered connected, which may allow-] {+simplest foundations+} for [-easier routing. In
extreme cases, a wormhole may-] {+that
multidisciplinary field.

My basic discoveries, both methodological and philosophical, should+} have [-one arrow leading from it-] {+pragmatic results. I hope+} to [-represent-] {+create a methodology that improves communication and database
design. I explore how we socially construct and use+} the [-inbound
connections-] {+term “data”. From this investigation, I can offer potential insights into how we create trading zones between different
cultures+} of [-all-] {+data use. While true understanding+} of the [-flows connected to the other wormhole. The only real restriction
is that the creation-] {+nature+} of [-wormholes should-] {+data may+} be [-unambiguous and clear both at-] {+outside+} the [-time-]

the design than-] {+not. Any methodology

this section will serve as a way+} to [-easily-] {+illuminate how people+} understand the nature of [-entities. For that reason, and as a
precursor-] {+data.

It seems quite feasible+} to [-group-based SDFN creation, I recommend-] {+extend this methodology to other research endeavors.


6.1 The Social Data Flow Network
This chapter documents+} the [-creation of an entity dictionary,

a simple list of entities that may be involved-] {+methodology I used+} in {+conducting+} the [-SDFN.

An entity dictionary is a simple, non-authoritative, brainstorming device in case-] {+interviews with+} the [-participant-]
{+company. This section+} is [-unsure about where to start. Instead-] {+organized first into definitions, an exploration+} of [-starting-] the SDFN [-with two
entities-] {+as a
concept,+} and {+then+} a [-flow connecting them, I-] {+practical discussion of running an interview centered on the SDFN.


6.1.1 Terms
This section+} will [-encourage-] {+introduce+} the [-participant to imagine all-] {+major terms of+} the
[-different entities with which they engage on a daily basis, to name them, and to describe
their roles. The immediate feedback, both positive-] {+SDFN+} and [-negative, on each described entity
teaches participants to think in-] {+how those+} terms {+are used.

The introduction+} of [-roles. Once they have filled-] a [-page, most will
have internalized the meaning of entity.

Through the creation of this-] {+new methodology, especially one borrowing from many different
fields, is fraught with definitional dangers.

An+} entity [-dictionary,-] {+is+} a [-number-] {+noun: a role that can manipulate data. A flow is a noun, representing
the flow+} of [-interesting themes will
appear, based on participant enthusiasm or repetition. Interviewers should be especially
careful to pay attention to offhand comments about entities-] {+communication+} or [-the participant’s work
during the creation of the dictionary, as these comments will most likely indicate interesting topics for the interview. The dictionary should be started by encouraging each
participant to name an entity that represents them in some role, and then the scope
should be gradually broadened to things and people they work with.

To those familiar with the DFD methodology, the idea of the-] {+symbols between entities. An+} entity dictionary is
[-almost completely opposite to that of the “data dictionary”-] {+a way+} of
{+brainstorming entities to make+} the [-DFD. While the Data
Dictionary-] {+participant feel more at ease.


6.1.1.1 Entity
An entity+} is {+something that plays+} a [-device for the accurate specification of data in the data flows, compiled
during and after-] {+role receiving, manipulating, or transmitting data. In+}
the [-creation-] {+SDFN, this act+} of [-the diagram, the entity dictionary-] {+input or output+} is {+represented by+} a [-piece of scaffolding
designed to help participants think the right way about entities.


Unlike-] {+noun described in+} a [-data flow diagram, the entity dictionary-] {+few words,

makes+} an [-“Address” flow,-] {+independent manipulation of data.

Roles are anything+} that {+can be conceptualized as an independent manipulator of
data. What differentiates an interesting role from one worth skipping over+} is [-subsequently decomposed

database-] {+whether the
role somehow transforms data passing through it. There is no restriction on the number
of roles that can belong to one person+} or [-programming structures. This requirement exists because-] {+thing. Just as one person can do multiple
jobs, one can also have multiple roles. One hypothesis for future testing is that+} the [-DFD-] {+role
determines the perceived affordances of data. Every role+} has its
[-roots as a programming design,-] {+own unique activities+}
and therefore [-must be able to explicitly define the-] {+uses+} data
[-structures-] {+in its own way. As the framing+} of [-a program. Because-] the [-SDFN is probing a non-computerized theoretical
area,-] {+role changes,+} the [-requirement-] {+definition+}
of [-precision is unnecessary and counter-productive,-] {+data may change along with it.

Participants should never describe themselves+} as [-it distracts
the participant from their task. The object-] {+a singular entity due to ambiguity.

Their description+} of [-the SDFN-] {+an entity as “self”+} is {+ambiguous+} to [-probe functional definitions,-] {+other people reading the chart,
who do+} not [-to have all participants arrive at-] {+understand+} the [-same constructed definition-] {+tacit assumptions+} of {+role and interaction from+} the [-UoD.

perspective as+} the [-SDFN
This section will describe-] {+participant. Instead, participants should articulate+} the [-process of creating a SDFN-] {+potentially
many roles that they play+} in

In this section, the steps towards creating a
SDFN will be described in the main text,
while speciﬁc examples from my experience
will be revealed in sidebars like this one.


brief,-] the [-SDFN begins through-] {+interview,+} the [-explanation of terms, a
summary-] {+self-identification+} of [-the ideas expressed above. If-]
{+roles also allows+} participants [-do not understand-] {+to adopt some of+} the [-nature-] {+framing+} of
[-entities, an entity dictionary should be created. When participants understand entity
and flow, a topic-] {+those roles. It+} is [-chosen and-] {+thought

[-drawn from the participant’s common work experience, to give them sufficient memories-] {+contrary+} to [-draw upon. The pre-defined topic sets-] the [-limits-] {+intent+} of [-exploration-] {+this exploration. This requirement
allows+} and [-acts as a UoD. When
those limits have been reached, the SDFN is completed.

In the interviews, I tried-] {+encourages people+} to [-avoid using
terms like “universe of discourse” or even
“ready-to-enhand” because the jargon only
distracted from the topic. Instead,-] {+represent passing information to themselves+} in the
[-small chat at the start-] {+guise+}
of the [-interview, I
asked them to tell me about their job. Then I
asked open questions about “interesting” aspects-] {+different roles they play.


The avoidance+} of [-their job, ones that involved data in
some way. This casual conversation-] {+ambiguity+} is [-crucial
for reassuring-] {+crucial. It makes+} the [-participant-] {+SDFN easier to interpret by other
people+} and [-steering
the direction of-] {+it forces+} the [-discussion. If-] {+individual creating+} the [-small
talk was not enough, we moved to a heavily
scaﬀolded entity dictionary,-] {+diagram+} to [-see what entities they are most interested in, and thereby
deﬁne-] {+define+} the [-universe-] {+nature+} of [-discourse.


Participants begin by describing or selecting two entities within-] the [-universe of discourse. One-] entity [-should be-]
{+explicitly. It is far too easy to use the self as+} a
[-role associated with-] {+catchall to avoid+} the [-participant for ease-] {+cognitive dissonance+}
of [-imagination-] {+thinking about thinking. It is important to document discrete+} and {+unambiguous roles,
even though they may map to+} the [-other can be anything with which-] {+same person, because it is+} the [-participant
interacts. Quite a lot of prompting will generally be necessary during this first interaction. Prompting should take-] {+role that understands
data, not+} the
[-form of open-ended questions, guiding-] {+person. Furthermore, these different roles-as-self can pass data to one
another. I used+} the [-participants-] {+following example in the interview: An entity as lecture designer
(myself) would pass requirements+} to
[-first establish their own-] {+the database lab developer (myself) who would
pass data to the lecturer (myself). Each of those+} roles [-as entities. Once they have
described themselves, they should identify-] {+has different requirements for+} the [-role-]
{+nature of data. Crucial insights would be lost if+} they [-in-

teract-] {+were all collapsed into one entity+}
with {+self-pointing flows of data.

Entities however, should not be ready-to-hand *. Devices that take on independent
roles are fundamentally different from those that function+} as {+parts of+} another [-entity, and then be guided-] {+entity.

The keyboard used for typing these letters+} into [-describing a flow between those
entities. Through-] {+this document should not be considered
an entity in+} the [-use of guiding open-ended questions and-] {+SDFN sense because except when engaging in this self-reflexive behavior,+}
the [-interviewer serving
as scribe, each participant should create-] {+entity “author of dissertation” does not explicitly pass data to+} the [-entities, flows, label-] {+keyboard-rather,+}
the [-flow, and then
categorize-] {+“author of dissertation” passes data to+} the [-flow.-] {+computer for processing.+} The [-interviewer should never label or categorize anything.

This process-] {+keyboard
is part+} of [-identifying flow and-] {+a large+} entity [-should continue-] {+and does not manipulate data+} in {+my own construction of data.

Instead, as+} an [-iterative loop

6.1.1.2 Flow
A diagram consisting solely of entities, known+} as [-something that was-] {+an entity dictionary, is+} not [-too hard and that-] {+particularly
useful. To represent relations among these nouns, however,+} we [-both knew,-] {+need flows. A flow indicates a transfer of something between one entity+} and [-if
I lost-] {+another. We are concerned with+}
the [-interview to technical problems, no
real harm would be done. The purpose-] {+nature+} of [-this
chat was my looking for nouns to pounce on
as entities: Clan, Clan Master, Game. Despite-] the [-small talk, these few lines described
enough entities to get started. Later, I asked-] {+transfer instead of+} the [-participant to describe-] {+act of the transfer, a verb describing how the
transfer is accomplished is not particularly useful during categorization.

This expressed relationship, usually, will be+} a [-ﬂow-] {+self-categorized flow of data, information, or knowledge. These flows are edges, represented by arcing lines+} between {+one
or more entities, although most flows link one entity to another, singular entity. There
is little objectivity in+} these [-entities.

Interviewer: When did you start that sort-] {+indications+} of
[-thing?
Participant: ... I signed up and started playing-] {+relationship. A flow represents+} a [-little bit. ... and that was-] {+documented
relationship, instantiated from the recipient’s understanding of reality, not necessarily+} a [-number-]
{+true thing in the shared reality+} of [-years ago. And ever since-] {+all participants. As the SDFN is intended as a tool for
exploring constructions of data+} there [-I’ve been
playing with-] {+is little need to find a design that corresponds to+}
the [-same clan-] {+real world+} and [-gaining more
responsibility throughout-] the [-years. At-] {+stakeholders’ needs. On+} the
[-moment, I’m a clan master.


ity-] {+contrary, the subjective expressions of
reality can be compared against each other to identify where areas of miscommunication
arise.

Practically speaking, flows+} must be [-caught immediately, before it can sabotage-] {+represented as arcing lines between one or
more entities. The arc allows readers to differentiate+} the

Roughly speaking,-] {+labels of each flow, with+} a [-weakly connected graph means that every-] {+clear
distinction between the over and the under component. Recursive flows, which link an+}
entity [-must somehow-] {+to itself, are discouraged, as they tend to represent ambiguous and broad entities.


Participants selecting recursive flows should+} be [-attached-] {+encouraged instead+} to [-all-] {+delineate+} the
{+starting and ending roles as+} entities [-present in-] {+more clearly.

Each flow has a label and a category. The label describes+} the [-SDFN. While “subgraphs” (groups-] {+content+} of [-entities not connected to-] the [-rest of-] {+flow.

at all) are possible, they tend-] {+flows+} to [-increase confusion-] {+other flows+} and {+ideas in the diagram. Each flow, above
the arc,+} should be [-dealt-] {+labeled+} with [-separately. “A directed graph

labeling-] {+discriminate+} and [-diagramming-] {+categorize+} flows. [-Although this research was rendered in Graphviz on
Linux workstations, any program that can render graphs can be used for post-processing.

with “Data, Information, Knowledge, or Other.”
There should always be the option for Other. But the Other category should never
remain as Other; the participant should name it. Some participants used categories such
as Emotion, Wisdom, or Request. In no case was a flow allowed+} to [-specific entities-] {+remain Other. These

precursor to group-based SDFN creation, I engaged some participants with creation of+} an [-excellent recording device because it recorded

teaches participants to think in terms+} of [-RF noise that can severely corrupt the recording.

Through+} the [-perspective-] {+creation+} of {+this entity dictionary,+} a [-workplace research

SDFNs rather than combine them into one.

By using diﬀerent sheets-] {+number+} of [-paper,-] {+interesting themes
will appear, based on participant enthusiasm or repetition.+} I was [-able-] {+especially careful+} to [-induce a cognitive break in the discussion
and some diﬀerences in philosophy appeared
between them. We chose-]
{+pay attention+} to [-do the second
SDFN mainly because-] {+offhand comments about entities or+} the [-ﬁrst one took so
little time. By being open to-] {+participant’s work during+} the [-needs and
energy levels-]
{+creation+} of the [-participant, I produced
an extra diagram and some-] {+dictionary, as these comments will most likely indicate+} interesting [-insights.


Ease of access is a function of recording availability
and limits-] {+topics
for+} the [-utility of many mini-recorders. Extracting
recordings from-] {+interview. The dictionary should be started by encouraging each participant to
name an entity that represents them in+} some [-recorders involves considerable effort
and requires proprietary software-] {+role,+} and [-cords. It is important-] {+then the scope should be gradually
broadened+} to [-test-] {+things and people they work with.

To those familiar with+} the [-full extraction process from all-] {+DFD methodology, the idea+} of the [-candidate
recording devices before engaging in an interview. If it-] {+entity dictionary+} is
[-not easily feasible-]

{+51

almost completely opposite+} to [-extract common file formats from-] {+that of+} the
[-device, select another device. Optimally,-] {+“data dictionary” of+} the [-device will produce an mp3 audio file, as that is-] {+DFD. While+} the [-de facto compressed

audio standard. Voice, being easily compressible,-] {+Data
Dictionary+} is a [-perfect fit-] {+device+} for [-mp3, and many
hours-] {+the accurate specification+} of [-recording can be stored with ease. An earlier uncompressed format (wav) is also

suitable, being compatible with any modern computer. The wav file sizes are, however,
much larger. Before-] {+data in+} the [-interview, make sure there is sufficient space on-] {+data flows, compiled
during and after+} the [-devices for
twice-] {+creation of+} the [-estimated interview length.

Paper selection-] {+diagram, the entity dictionary+} is [-significantly easier. A large pad-] {+a piece+} of [-paper is sufficient, though
higher quality pads are desirable as they will tear less easily, and absorb the ink from-] {+scaffolding
designed to help participants think+} the [-pens. Fast drying pens are preferred, though any tip will work. Each sheet on-] {+right way about entities.

Unlike a data flow diagram,+} the
[-pad should be labeled as it-] {+entity dictionary+} is [-used-] {+not authoritative *. In a DFD,
all flows must be decomposed † to their atomic definitions ‡, which correspond+} with
{+database or programming structures. This requirement exists because+} the [-number of the interview, the page count,-] {+DFD has its
roots as a programming design,+} and {+therefore must be able to explicitly define+} the [-date. In case the pages are arranged out-] {+data
structures+} of [-order, this information-] {+a program. Because the SDFN+} is [-sufficient to

area,+} the [-drawing order-] {+requirement of precision is unnecessary+} and [-interview.


6.2.4 Timing-] {+counter-productive, as it distracts
the participant from their task.+} The [-interviewer should allocate around 15 minutes on both sides-] {+object+} of the [-interview for
equipment preparation. During the interview, another 10-] {+SDFN is+} to [-15 minutes should be spent
on breaking-] {+probe functional definitions,
not to have all participants arrive at+} the [-ice and making-] {+same constructed definition of+} the [-interviewee comfortable.-] {+UoD.


6.1.2+} Creating the SDFN
{+This section+} will [-take
half an hour to an hour, depending on how complex-] {+describe the process of creating+} a [-diagram-] {+SDFN in full. This describes+} the [-participant desires.

Although it is theoretically possible to compile-] {+methodology used in+} the [-answers for a bubble diagram very
quickly, try to encourage-] {+study presented in+} the [-participant until either a page is filled or he or she is clearly
horribly lost.

A subsequent discussion, once-] {+next chapter. In brief,+} the SDFN [-has been completed, is completely optional.

Some of the people I interviewed wanted to reflect, whereas others, uncomfortable with-] {+begins through+}
the [-procedure, did not. Due to this huge variation, there is no standard duration for this
discussion, because it can go as long as-] {+explanation of terms, a summary of+} the [-participant would like it to go. It is unusual,
however, for it to go more than half an hour.-] {+ideas expressed above.+} If {+participants do
not understand+} the [-participant is still interested after

contraindicated on both theoretical and practical levels. Theoretically, it-] {+decomposition may be an “Address” flow, that+} is {+subsequently decomposed
into 4 flows “street address + city + state + postal code” In the same way,+} a [-bad idea to
introduce any sense of distance or remoteness,-] {+transformation can be decomposed. “Mail a letter” can be decomposed into “Look up address -> Find Zip Code -> Assess Postage ->
Attach letter”
For example, a “string” is defined+} as [-it will just increase the difficulties-] {+a "series+} of
[-icebreaking. Practically, the sheet will change hands many times, and-] {+characters from+} a [-short distance

measures will help with post-processing operations.


6.3 Conducting the Interview
The interview necessary-] {+small talk was not enough, move+} to [-explore-] the [-philosophy-]
{+creation+} of [-data has three phases. Initially, the
interviewer should collect demographics through the introduction. The introduction is
primarily-] a [-means-] {+heavily scaffolded entity dictionary,+} to [-diffuse anxiety-] {+see what entities they are most
interested in,+} and [-to gain the critical basis for comparison between
parties. The second phase is that of constructing-] {+thereby define+} the [-SDFN. The SDFN exposes-] {+UoD.

Participants begin by describing or selecting two entities within+} the [-practical
philosophies of-] {+UoD. One entity
should be a role associated with+} the [-participant. The final component-] {+participant for ease+} of {+imagination and+} the [-interview, the denouement,
tends to-] {+other
can+} be {+anything with which the participant interacts. Quite+} a [-discussion-] {+lot+} of {+prompting will
generally be necessary during this first interaction. Prompting should take+} the [-philosophy-] {+form+}
of [-data uncovered by-] {+open-ended questions, guiding+} the [-SDFN.


6.3.1 Introduction
The introduction serves multiple purposes. Primarily, it diffuses anxiety, explains-] {+participants to first establish their own roles as
entities. Once they have described themselves, they should identify+} the
[-background-] {+role they interact

The Universe+} of {+Discourse is+} the [-subject,-] {+bounded realm under investigation.


with as another entity,+} and [-creates-] {+then be guided into describing+} a [-scaffold for-] {+flow between those entities.

Through+} the [-intuitive prompting-] {+use+} of {+guiding open-ended questions and+} the [-SDFN.

In these interviews, people display many different sources of anxiety.

The most common is a sort of performance anxiety, wherein they do not believe
their opinions are sufficiently privileged to contribute to a “philosophy of data.” Another
common difficulty is job anxiety. Participants may feel that they are revealing secrets of
their job to an outsider who, either-] {+interviewer serving+} as [-a spy for management or for some other reason,
would steal the secrets to-] {+scribe,
each participant should create+} the [-participant’s detriment. It is vital, in this stage, to reassure-] {+entities, flows, label+} the [-participants of-] {+flow, and then categorize+} the [-intent-]
{+flow. The interviewer should never label or categorize anything.

This process+} of [-the interview-] {+identifying flow+} and [-to make them feel in control-as they
in fact are.

The participant is-] {+entity should continue+} in [-control of the interview. One way to demonstrate that control
is with the ethics declaration. Besides expressing-] {+an iterative loop
until+} the [-uses to which-] {+interviewee starts tiring. Generally,+} the [-interview-] {+topic+} will be [-put, the ethics declaration can serve to break-] {+sufficiently broad for+} a [-coercive loop. The loop begins-] {+30to 40-minute diagramming session. If you end earlier, repeat+} with

[-55

management at the participant’s location being involved-] {+a different topic+} in
{+a new diagram. After identifying+} the [-recruitment process.

Employees feel as if they need to participate or face negative repercussions at their job.-] {+first pair of entities, however, the order changes.+}
The [-counter to this fear is-] {+subject should be encouraged+} to [-explicitly give participants the option-] {+identify a flow first, and then+} to [-opt out-] {+add entities as
necessary. Participants should only create one new entity+} at [-any time
while preserving the fiction of their excellent engagement in the interview. My phrasing was,
“By signing this ethics form, we have already had-] a [-fantastic interview, by definition. At
any-] time, [-you may choose-] {+and then try+} to [-revoke consent by signing that-] {+relate+}
other [-form, but this won’t
change the fact that we’ve had an excellent interview.” It is in this explicit transfer of
control-] {+entities to+} that [-provides one-] {+one.

The graph, for purposes+} of [-the primary functions-] {+clarity and ease+} of [-reassurance-] {+expression, should remain at least
weakly connected *. Isolated subgraphs should be moved+} to {+their own papers and explored as completely different graphs. Separating+} the [-participant.

The [-SDFN allows for-] {+most common is+} a [-very solid investigation-] {+sort+} of [-interesting philosophical

The [-self-generation-] {+other goal+} of [-a theoretical definition from-] the

it could be a communication, it could-] {+categorization. This explanation should+} be [-a conversation or a story.

Something verbal.

Interviewer: So Information is any non-...

Participant: Data-] {+far less philosophical than even the
descriptions presented above. A flow,+} to [-me-] {+participants,+} is [-physical, basically. It’s an-] {+“any flow of data, information,
or knowledge between one+} entity [-that [fuzzy
word]-] {+or another”;+} an entity [-of some sort.

Interviewer: You would say that letter is Data?
Participant: I would say that letter is Data. But what-] is [-on-] {+“a person, place, or thing+} that [-Data-]
{+can interact with the flows.” This+} is
[-Information. Just to be-] a [-bit confusing.

Interviewer: Tell me more.

Participant: Coming from-] {+significant point of divergence for participants.

different areas. It would be,-] {+nature of entities quite clearly,+} as [-I’ve said, Data or record. That’s just the

language, and others will not. If it looks as though+} the [-“what’s on-] {+participant does not understand,

word.

Participant: I’m quite happy with that.

Interviewer: You say physical at some point?
Participant: Yes, physical in [unintelligable]. It doesn’t actually have

64-] to [-be physical in a piece-] {+categorize the nature+} of [-paper, but it can be physical as in an e-mail
message.


Whereas, in a different interview, we have-]
the [-combinative “and”:
Interviewer: Analysis, explanation. Analysis is?
Participant: Something like: model outputs or calculations. Explanation is what that actually means in context of your [work environment].

Interviewer: Class of analysis is Data, Information, Knowledge?
Participant: It’s probably more on the Information. Well,-] {+flow, whether+} it’s [-Data and
Information. And-] {+data, information, knowledge, or other.”
If+} the [-explanation-] {+participant+} is [-Knowledge, it had better be.

Interviewer: When you say that, what do you mean?
Participant: You hope that when someone gives you-] {+confused about entities, help them to create an entity dictionary.

Ask them to describe typical entities from+} their [-explanation,
you know more than before they told you. Not always true. They can
tell you stuff,-] {+workday+} and [-you can go “Well, I understand even less than when I
started.” Because if it’s completely contradictory-] to [-your understanding, you are now really confused. And-] {+describe themselves+} in
{+various roles. Then ask them to describe other roles and things with which they work.

The building of+} the [-cross cultural... you’re
often doing these meetings-] {+entity dictionary provides the maximum scaffolding for teaching
them about the nature of entities.


6.2.2 SDFN Building
After the participant was comfortable+} with [-interpreters in-] the [-room. Am-] {+topic, and an entity dictionary was built
(if appropriate), the SDFN began.+} I [-not-] {+avoided+} asking [-it right? You don’t necessarily get an interpreter that speaks
Technical [other language]. Often they’re here-] for [-some other meeting,
and they just bring someone from one-] {+definitions+} of [-the marketers who will be
bilingual. Now, they all are bilingual, but particularly senior people
will choose not to speak English because it’s embarrassing when they
speak badly. That said, we can’t speak [other language], so who are we-] {+data+} to [-criticize?-] {+avoid contaminating their categories with half-remembered definitions from their educational
days.+}
The [-keyword “and”-] {+SDFN is designed to encourage participants to intuitively define their understanding+} of [-“Analysis-] {+data. Classification+} is [-data-] {+a way of probing operational (rather than theoretical)
understanding. Repeatedly confronting people with their “gut reactions” creates a cognitive dissonance * between the theory+} and [-information” means-] {+practice+} that [-they are combinable and can sit in one flow.-] {+the participant will articulate
during the process.

It was important to engage the participant as a subject-matter expert.+} The [-concatenative idea is-] {+SDFN
should explore+} a [-lot more difficult. Although
in-] {+safe topic within+} the [-following example I allude to-] {+subject’s expertise. A project,+} a [-container,-] {+process, or everyday interactions are excellent topical areas, as long as+} the [-interaction between data and information is not-] {+participants have a strong
familiarity with+} the [-strict container-] {+domain. The choice+} of {+topic is important because it empowers+} the [-first example, but rather has more “alongside”

little bit-] {+domain reduces their uncertainty and fears+} of [-raw Data, but not very much.

Participant: Usually photos or a graph.

{+inherent in+} the [-affordances-] {+discussion.


6.2.2.1 Methodology+} of the [-thing being related in-] {+SDFN
When constructing+} the [-metaphor. Therefore, a container
metaphor affords “putting into.” It is by analysis of which set of affordances is hinted at most strongly by-] {+SDFN, I acted as primary scribe. While+} the participant {+should
have access to a pen so+} that [-important clues are gleaned towards-] {+he or she can scribble corrections,+} the [-participant’s philosophy-] {+interviewer will do
most+} of [-data.


Participant: Yes.

Interviewer: Would you say that-] the [-raw data is contained in-] {+drawing. Because+} the [-Information? i.e. you send them interpretation of measurements. As part-] {+activity+} of
[-that interpretation you have-] {+the SDFN is+} to [-send them some-] {+iteratively construct flows+} of
{+“data, information, and knowledge” between entities described by+} the [-measurements
that are really interesting. Would you say that the Data is inside-] {+participant as+} the
[-Information flow, and we can just label-]
{+subject-matter expert,+} this [-as Information? Or would
you say that it’s Information + Data?
Participant: I’d keep it inside-] {+section will discuss+} the [-Information flow, because if it was
just raw Data. They could very easily reach what-] {+structure+} I [-think is the wrong
idea – misinterpret.

Interviewer: Therefore, you’re not going: “Here’s the Information,
here’s the Data.” You’re going “Here’s the Information, here’s some
Data inside the Information-] {+provided+} to [-back it up.”
Participant: Yeah, that’s right. But-] {+participants.

Describing a flow always began+} with [-just the raw numbers and no
context, that’s Data.


This discussion, if fruitful, will lead into definitions. Having looked at the ontological transitions in the discussion above, the-] {+entity declaration. The+} participant [-may now be prepared to examine-] {+declared
which two entities+} the [-ontological definitions of-] {+flow is between and then declares+} the [-various categories. Here,-] {+flow itself. My prompting+}
for {+categorization changed throughout+} the [-interviewer, is one of
the more treacherous spots of-] {+interview. Initially,+} the [-presentation, because it is extremely easy to put words
into-] {+questions were quite
explicit. “Who starts+} the [-participant’s mouth through suggestions or overly specific leading questions.

Instead,-] {+flow? What do they do?” In this high-scaffolding variant, I
explicitly identified+} the [-interviewer should try to allow-] {+source of+} the {+flow and then guided+} participants to [-use their own inductive
process on-] {+identify+} the [-categories-]
{+destination+} and [-transitions they have defined. Normally,-] {+then+} the [-basis-] {+nature+} of the
[-definitions will occur in-] {+flow. By reducing+} the [-discussion-] {+focus+} of [-transitions, but it may-] {+the question to the
smallest possible parts, I helped the participant+} not [-happen-] {+to feel confused by trying to think
about too many unfamiliar things at once. Early+} in [-every
case. If possible, guide-] the [-participants to identify and discuss their own thoughts of how
they categorized something as data.

Although-] {+interview, breaking+} the [-relationship-] questions [-are normally deeper, leading-]
into [-this discussion through transitions means that the various affordances and other philosophical
handles of data, information, and knowledge will be discussed first. Data, lacking form,

positive+} and [-thereby

strongly hint at-] {+negative reinforcement,+} their [-philosophy-] {+awareness+} of [-data. The other component is to ask them-] {+expectations reduced the need

{+process. Different portions of this chapter will refer to different elements.


ing the source entity, my decision tree was simple: Does the entity exist? If it does not
exist,+} is [-complete, post-interview processing is relatively straightforward.

The main process involved is transcribing-] the [-recordings and paper into electronic storage. With-] {+role that+} the [-recordings, doing so entails making backups, then processing-] {+participant described short and unambiguous? Entities must
have short names, as names take up valuable space. If+} the [-audio in
Audacity. The diagram should be processed through Graphviz.

The first stage-] {+entity bubble+} is [-the post-processing in Audacity. Although Audacity offers a
“clearvoice” option-] {+more than
about an inch+} in [-its preference settings, I found manual manipulations to be-] {+diameter, it takes up too+} much
[-more useful. Recordings will routinely suffer from two problems: low dynamic range-] {+space+} and [-high background noise. It-] is [-important-] {+likely+} to [-eliminate the noise before manipulating-] {+require redrawing+}
the [-dynamic range, as-] {+diagram.

I encouraged+} the [-volume modulations will affect-] {+participant to generalize to+} the [-noise levels.

To reduce-] {+point that+} the [-noise-] {+entity can rea-

sonably cover all objects+} in [-the recording, find a long silence, lasting five seconds or
more, where neither participant-] {+its class. “Person”+} is [-speaking. If possible, use the silence recorded at-] {+too vague; it does not give+} the
[-start-] {+reader
any sense+} of {+what role+} the [-interview,-] {+person occupies. “Brian” is both too vague and too specific:
it identifies a specific person,+} but [-any moment-] {+does not suggest his role (thereby requiring more
explanation) and does not allow for similar types+} of [-silence recorded during the interview will-] {+person. Good entities would+} be [-acceptable. It should go without saying that the recorder must not-]
{+“Dissertation Author” or “Casual Reader” or “Examiner.” They can+} be [-set-] {+generalized+} to [-avoid
recording periods of silence. Highlight the section of silence,-] {+one+}
and [-then choose the noiseremoval effect from the effects menu. The default settings-] {+only one role; they+} are [-normally acceptable, but
with high-noise situations, you may want-] {+simple (few words), and they allow for anyone who fits that
role+} to [-apply-] {+be classified without unnecessary recourse to edge cases. By using examples from
my personal experience, I was able to consistently give+} the [-process-] {+same scenario example across+}
multiple [-times.-] {+interviews, without looking as if I was reading from a script.+}
With the
[-noise selected, choose the “get noise sample” button. Then, highlight-] {+source constructed,+} the [-entire clip,
choose noise removal again, and instruct it-] {+participant needs+} to [-remove noise. This process will take a few

minutes, but will dramatically reduce the noise in the sample, at the cost of making-] {+define+} the
[-voices sound tinny.

To increase-] {+destination using+}
the [-volume of-] {+same methodology. Later,+} the [-recording, a counter-intuitive practice is required.

One speaker will usually-] {+scaffolding can mostly+} be [-louder than-] {+withdrawn and+} the [-other, due to-] {+entire
process summarized with an “And then?” as the participant understands what is being
asked. The transition should be gradual, rather than abrupt, and is predicated on+} the [-placement-]
{+error rate+} of the [-recording
device. A simple volume increase will make-] {+participant. If+} the [-voice of one speaker (usually-] {+error rate increases, I increased+} the [-interviewer) intolerably loud. Normalization will also fail-] {+scaffolding+} to [-have-]
{+compensate.

Once+} the [-desired effect, again
because of-] {+entities are identified and written,+} the [-unusual dynamic range between-] {+participant should describe a flow.

Using an arcing path with a clear “above and below,” connect+} the two [-speakers’ voices. The best option-] {+entities. These
arcing lines, representing flows, are oriented to the entities, not the page.+} I [-have found is-] {+rotated+} the [-plug-in called Chris’s Dynamic Compressor *.-]
{+page if it allowed for cleaner arcs and more space above and below for description.+}
With the [-noise removed,
this plug-in serves to make both voices-] {+role description+} in [-a recording sound roughly-] {+mind,+} the [-same, for-] {+participant was asked to note what the
flow contains with+} a
[-remarkable improvement in transcription quality.

During transcription,-] {+theme and variations on: “This is a flow of...”+} I made [-many typos. The
essence of-] {+sure, when
asking these questions, that they were as open-ended as possible. Flows also must be
unambiguous. Ambiguity may be introduced via+} the [-transcription process-] {+introduction of other, similarly
named flows. When a flow+} is [-to aim-] {+described, check all the extant flows+} for [-“good enough” quality. Although there
are programs that can automatically encode
aspects of meta-data-] {+identical and
similar names. In the case+} of {+an identical name, inquire whether+} the [-conversation, who
is speaking when and correlating it with-] {+same contents are

flowing. If+} the
[-audio ﬁle,-] {+names are similar, make sure there are enough adjectives around+} the [-most eﬀective means of transcription-] {+flow
to distinguish the two.+} I [-found was Google Docs, a foot
pedal control for-] {+edited+} the [-playback device,-] {+prior flow if it makes more sense to do so.

When the flow has been described,+} and the [-program called Express Scribe. Featurerich programs are good, but-] {+noun (with or without adjectives) has
been written above+} the [-minimal interface of Express Scribe was all that was
truly necessary. Again,-] {+arc, then prompt the participant to categorize the arc+} as {+data,
information, or knowledge: “And is this flow of x data, information, knowledge, or other?”
Unusually,+} this {+element of scaffolding+} is {+never completely removed, although it may be
shortened as appropriate if the participant has already categorized things of its nature
on the diagram.


6.2.3 Theoretical Discussion
Having spent at least+} a [-philosophical exploration rather than a linguistic
one, transcribing every “um” and “er” is unnecessary.


After transcription, render-] {+productive half an hour on+} the [-hand-written-] SDFN [-into-] {+building, participants were
then encouraged to conclude the session with+} a [-computerized visualization. While I was quite successful
using Graphviz, many other programs available for many different operating systems can provide renderings-] {+theoretical discussion on their own
revealed constructions+} of [-directed
graphs. The important thing-] {+data. Not all participants will want+} to [-note is that-] {+have this discussion,
and beyond a vague prompt of “And would you like to talk about your thoughts on+}
the [-program
should provide for very quick data entry:-] {+philosophy of data?”,+} it is [-better-] {+not worth the effort+} to [-have

a high initial time cost in setting up regular expressions †-] {+force reevaluations here. This
discussion generally explores the ontological+} and
[-interpreting programs than to have to spend time rendering each individual SDFN. Especially if there are 10 or more
diagrams, creating a rendering engine can be quite effective.

A regular expression is a way-] {+epistemological questions and novel
categorizations that arose during the SDFNcreation.

Participants, if not uncomfortable from the unusual thinking demands+} of [-programming patterns into-] the [-computer-] {+SDFN,
generally engaged in a self-reflective discussion. It was vital to ask open questions that
build a scaffold+} for [-expansion and interpretation. For details of-] the [-regular expressions used, see Appendix B.


6.4 Survey
During-] {+participant’s self-discovery.

Of interest in+} the [-process-] {+discussion are how the participant transitioned from one+} of [-collecting data, an unexpected opportunity arose:-]
{+the categories to another. The SDFN allows for+} a [-mailing list-] {+very solid investigation+} of
[-retired intelligence officers and agents was interested in my research. To take advantage-] {+interesting
questions+} of {+categorization. In+} this [-opportunity,-] {+case,+} I [-created a survey. Optimistically, the first survey-] was [-a direct copy
of the interview process, starting with a complex demographic interrogation, asking-] {+exploring how+} the
[-participants to create flows and entities,-] {+participant categorized
things as data, information, or knowledge, their boundaries,+} and [-then asking them to self-direct-] their [-own
investigation into the philosophy-] {+transitions.


The main opportunity+} of [-data.

It was a complete failure.

In-] the [-first survey pilot test, 18 people attempted-] {+discussion is+} to [-complete-] {+study how+} the [-survey. Only-] {+participant thought
about+} the [-person who had participated-] {+interaction between categories. In many interviews, the participants would
construct a hierarchy+} in [-my interviews had any idea of what-] the [-survey was
talking about,-] {+theoretical discussion+} and [-even that attempt produced no useful data. Most-] {+discuss how data became information. The self-generation+} of {+a theoretical ontology of data from+} the [-participants
failed to complete the survey after taking-] {+practical
categorization experience is+} the [-demographics section as an exemplar-] {+main purpose+} of {+this methodology.

Other items to query include any departures from+} the [-whole,-] {+normal flows. The participant, when creating the SDFN, will prefer certain categories to others, depending on topic+}
and [-stalled horribly at-] {+personal preference. When given+} the [-“now describe an entity” section.-] {+opportunity,+} I [-believe the people who attempted-] {+tried to ask about+} the [-survey ran into two significant problems.

The first, and more critical, was-] {+unusual
categories: instances in which+} the [-symptom known as “tl;dr”-] {+participant either made up a category, combined+} or [-“too long; did not read.”
An associate, practiced in survey creation, suggested that no one taking-]
{+concatenated categories, or used+} a [-survey would
read more than three sentences-] {+rare classification. For example, when certain participants strongly favored data, only a few flows were classified as knowledge, mainly
because they fell outside the scope+} of [-instructions. As these surveys presented multiple
paragraphs detailing and defining terms, it was clear that-] the [-obstacle-] {+discussion. Subsequent conversation then
focused on those flows to try to get a balanced understanding+} of [-tl;dr was in full
effect.

More subtly, though,-] {+their nature.

When discussing combined or concatenated flows, it is important to understand+}
the [-very abstract and theoretical nature-] {+type+} of {+metaphor that+} the [-questions was a
problem-] {+participant is using [55]. While this is mostly important+}
in [-creating scaffolding. In the interview, because-] {+terms of analysis, my participants normally used low key but figurative metaphors.

During this process,+} I [-was able-] {+tried+} to [-provide assistance-] {+ensure that they elaborated on each metaphor+} and [-incremental steps according to my assessment of the participant’s comprehension,
I do not believe that any participant found the process exceedingly difficult. Rather,
because the survey was self-guided, its impersonality was its primary point of failure.


In the interest of making a survey that people could finish quickly, I had created one
that was not able to adapt the scaffolding processes that made the interviews successful.

Therefore,-] {+clearly
distinguished+} the [-only people to complete it-] {+type they+} were [-those who already knew about the concepts
being discussed: one of my interview participants, and an academic who specialized in
teaching the DFD methodology.

From this failure, I learned that a new methodology would be required. The primary
lesson was that the direct translation of interview techniques failed. My intuition was-] {+using. A container metaphor (“data holds information”)
is different from+} that [-the success of the interview was based on the feedback given by the interviewer, not
the structure-] of [-the interview per se. In an online survey, people expect mostly to click
answers, rather than to type essays in-] a [-web form. Very few long-answer questions-] {+concatenative metaphor (“data alongside information”) and
both+} are
[-appropriate to such-] {+different from+} a [-format, however,-] {+combinatory metaphor (“data+} and [-a survey comprised entirely-] {+information”).

A brief discussion+} of [-them-] {+metaphor+} is [-wholly
inappropriate for anything but a final exam. The informal nature of a survey makes
the kind-] {+in order. Participants gave me clues to their
personal construction+} of [-focused concentration required-] {+data through their use+} of [-long answers quite difficult,-] {+metaphor,+} especially
[-considering the lack-] {+their use+} of [-any reward besides-]
{+verbal affordances. Anytime+} the [-completion itself. It-] {+participants said, “filter data,” it+} was [-also-] a [-mistake to
establish expectations-] {+strong clue that
they were very interested+} in [-the demographic area-] {+subjective masses+} of [-the survey and then violate them on
the next page through a longer theoretical component.

When considering what to include in my second attempt, I could not simply consider all the myriad ways-] {+data+} that [-the first survey failed. It was also important-] {+needed+} to [-understand
the few ways in which the first survey succeeded. The two principal successes-] {+be winnowed down.

Discussions+} of [-the
first survey were in the demographic section-] {+precision+} and {+accuracy, or any kind of implicit meta-data were pointers to

objective elements.

An example of container metaphor+} in [-the tool itself. The demographic
section successfully captured interesting demographic information at a high granularity.

The tool, Limesurvey, performed far beyond expectations. It-] {+action:

surveys-] {+Information?
Participant: It’s something that’s not physical, basically. That means
it could be a communication, it could be a conversation or a story.

Something verbal.

Interviewer: So Information+} is [-streamlined and very functional.

A slavish copy of the methodology of the interview was clearly unsuccessful, and

so-] any [-theme and variation on-] {+non-...

Participant: Data to me is physical, basically. It’s an entity+} that {+[fuzzy
word] an entity of some sort.

Interviewer: You+} would [-almost certainly share the same fate.-] {+say that letter is Data?
Participant:+} I [-had
to reconsider-] {+would say that letter is Data. But+} what [-question it was-] {+is on+} that [-I was trying-] {+Data is
Information. Just+} to [-answer. In-] {+be a bit confusing.

Interviewer: Tell me more.

Participant: Coming from+} the [-first survey,-] {+field we’re in, in [removed]. You’ve got
different areas. It would be, as I’ve said, Data or record. That’s just+} the
[-question developed into, “With-]

I notice the “what’s on that Data is Information”, because “on” is+} a [-self-constructed SDFN, can you articulate your own
philosophies of data, information, and knowledge?” The respondents presented-] {+“container”
word.

Interviewer: Data is+} a [-very
straightforward answer: “No.” The essence-] {+container...

Participant: Yes,+} of the [-SDFN-] {+Information.

Interviewer: And Information+} is [-in the process-] {+content+} of [-categorization.

Although the interview length lent itself-] {+what type? Is there something common+} to {+all Information?

roles and their own data transfers, the essence-] {+struggle. Information,

Interviewer: We have right now Data
Participant: And then+} of [-the SDFN was-] {+course you get Knowledge.

Interviewer: We have Data, Data is a container for Information.

Participant: I’m quite happy with that.

Interviewer: You say physical at some point?
Participant: Yes, physical+} in [-enticing categorization
of many different, and distinct, flows.

I realized that it was possible to remove person-specific flows and allow people-] {+[unintelligible]. It doesn’t actually have+}
to [-classify-] {+be physical in+} a [-general set-] {+piece+} of [-scenarios. I wanted to explore a specific question: “How
does-] {+paper, but it can be physical as in an e-mail
message.


Whereas, in+} a [-specific role categorize data, information, and knowledge.” The question of role
was tricky, despite the success of the demographics section; the participants’ answers
did not suggest which role headspace they were considering their answers from. A
hypothesis, while creating this, was that people would have-] different [-answers to-] {+interview, we have+} the
[-categories depending-] {+combinative “and”:
Interviewer: Analysis, explanation. Analysis is?
Participant: Something like: model outputs or calculations. Explanation is what that actually means in context of your [work environment].


Interviewer: Class of analysis is Data, Information, Knowledge?

Information. And+} the [-time-an-] explanation
[-substantiated by the remarkably different interview answers one participant gave-] {+is Knowledge, it had better be.

Interviewer: When you say that, what do you mean?
Participant: You hope that+} when
[-interviewed twice about remarkably different topics.-] {+someone gives you their explanation,
you know more than before they told you. Not always true. They can
tell you stuff, and you can go “Well,+} I [-needed to assess the person’s
role, rather-] {+understand even less+} than [-just his or her generalized demographics while keeping the results-] {+when I
started.” Because if it’s+} completely [-anonymous. As the scope of the prior project was-] {+contradictory to your understanding, you are now really confused. And+} in [-many ways its fatal flaw,
minimalism was the rule of-] the [-day-] {+cross cultural... you’re
often doing these meetings with interpreters+} in the [-second attempt.

asking it right? You don’t necessarily get an interpreter that speaks

and [-Techniques-] {+they just bring someone from one+} of the [-Survey

section of the first survey, which asked-] {+marketers who will be

{+will choose not+} to [-write an essay on their philosophy of

data, was removed, the demographics section was reduced-] {+speak English because it’s embarrassing when they
speak badly. That said, we can’t speak [other language], so who are we+}
to [-one question,-] {+criticize?

The keyword “and” of “Analysis is data+} and [-the flow

While people were quite willing to answer the demographic questions, as stated
earlier, I feel-] {+information” meant+} that [-the initial questions distracted from-] {+they are combinable+} and [-reduced peoples’ attention
span for the subsequent survey.-] {+can sit in one flow.+} The [-only demographic question that really matters-] {+concatenative idea+} is
[-about the participant’s mindset.

The new survey asked participants to “vividly imagine”-] a [-role, thereby artificially
putting them into that role’s mindset. Asking participants to engage-] {+lot more difficult. Although+}
in {+the following example I allude to+} a [-specific mindset-] {+container, the interaction between data and information+} is [-effectively asking them-] {+not the strict container of the first example, but rather has more “alongside”
affordances *:

that [-role as-] {+interpretation you have to send them some of+} the [-scenarios-] {+measurements
that+} are [-filtered through-] {+really interesting. Would you say that+} the [-mental maps imposed by-] {+Data is inside+} the

By asking participants to vividly imagine-]
{+Information flow,+} and [-then describe that role, the survey
made it possible for them to reveal as little or as much-] {+we can just label this+} as [-they wanted about their thinking

the [-terms.

idea – misinterpret.

Interviewer: Therefore, you’re not going: “Here’s+} the [-survey. The dropdown box asks participants
to choose Data,-] Information, [-Knowledge, or Other. If they choose Other, a text
box appears for more details.


After vividly imagining and describing a role,-]
{+here’s+} the [-survey moved into-] {+Data.” You’re going “Here’s+} the [-pure measuring
phase. This phase involved presentation of a one-sentence scenario-] {+Information, here’s some

Participant: Yeah, that’s right. But+} with [-a term highlighted-] {+just the raw numbers and no
context, that’s Data.


This discussion, if fruitful, will lead into definitions. Having looked at the ontological transitions+} in [-bold *. The first scenario was, “Alice receives a letter from Bob.” The survey
requested: “Please read-] the [-following-] {+discussion above, the participant may now be prepared to examine
the ontological definitions of the various categories. Here was+} one [-sentence scenario. Categorize-] {+of+} the [-highlighted
word-] {+more treacherous spots of the presentation, because it would have been extremely easy to put words

Instead, I tried to allow the participants to use their own inductive process on the
categories and transitions they have defined. Normally, the basis of the definitions will
occur+} in the [-context-] {+discussion+} of {+transitions, but it may not happen in every case. If possible,
guide+} the [-scenario.” Participants were asked-] {+participants+} to [-classify via a
drop-down box whether a given scenario was “Data, Information, Knowledge, or Other”
and, if they chose other, a text-box appeared so that they could enter-] {+identify and discuss+} their own [-classification. Happily,-] {+thoughts of how they categorized
something as data.

Although the relationship questions are normally deeper, leading into+} this [-option was often utilized, suggesting-] {+discussion through transitions means+} that [-most participants did not
choose a false category-] {+the various affordances and other philosophical
handles+} of data, information, {+and knowledge will be discussed first. Data, lacking form,

{+SDFN caused the participant to suggest their own affordances, and thereby strongly hint

at their conception of data. The other component is to ask them to discuss their understanding of how they know something is data or of how+} they {+categorize it. The only
structure possible here is that provided by the SDFN itself. The participants+} were [-then encouraged-] {+also
prompted+} to explain [-themselves: “Please explain in one or two sentences why you categorized-] {+their categorization methodologies.


6.3 Survey
After+} the
[-scenario that way.” This phrasing offered participants-] {+completion of+} the [-choice-] {+interview process, a decision+} to [-engage in as much
self-reflection as they wanted about-] {+create a survey was made.

The purpose of+} the [-only critical thing that mattered:-] {+survey would be to test two things: would it be possible to replicate+}
the [-act-] {+success+} of
[-categorization. While it-] {+the interview technique in a more automated form and+} would [-have been desirable to have-] {+the different
constructions of data be evident in+} a more [-comprehensive survey,
I feel that-] {+varied audience? Unfortunately,+} the [-second-] survey [-incorporated the lessons learned-]
{+suffers+} from [-the first-] {+both methodological+} and [-was able
to produce some surprising results, regardless of its small scope.

The audience for this survey was chosen very informally from three roughly distinct
groups. The first group “chosen” was from my social networks via Twitter-] {+coding flaws,+} and [-Facebook.

This group was initially contacted to pilot test the survey. The power of social networking

6.5 Bubble Diagram Case Study
The technical pilot interview-] {+first survey+} was {+a
direct copy of+} the [-first-] interview [-conducted, and it served two purposes: to vet the equipment, and to provide-] {+process, starting with+} a [-test of-] {+complex demographic interrogation,

As we can see,-] the [-entities are just sketchy bubbles with entity names in them, which

because+} the [-participant:
Interviewer: Well, we’ll be getting back-] {+survey was self-guided, its impersonality was its primary point of failure.

In the interest of making a survey that people could finish quickly, I had created one

deeply, you go, ’Oh, hang on.’ It’s not just making arbitrary distinction
that this is knowledge and-]
{+teaching the DFD methodology.

lesson was+} that [-data?” That really is knowledge

Participant: Does that include knowledge?
Interviewer: Does it include knowledge?
Participant: Point Taken.

Interviewer: And then are going to be arcing lines sometimes with an

When considering what to include in my second attempt, I+} could [-say this is data, or-] {+not simply consider all the myriad ways+} that

[-define about that transmission. We’ll label that line as.

Participant: Oh, so are they different classifications?
Interviewer: There are whatever classifications you want. What I’m
going to be doing here, is looking-] {+understand
the few ways in which the first survey succeeded. The two principal successes of the
first survey were in the demographic section and in the tool itself. The demographic
section successfully captured interesting demographic information+} at [-how you classify these things,-] {+a high granularity.

The tool, Limesurvey, performed far beyond expectations. It is well written, databaseagnostic, secure, free,+} and
[-what small groups you identify-] {+open source. The mechanism for importing+} and [-how you think that other people
classify these things. And then compare it to how other people classify-] {+exporting
surveys is streamlined and very functional.

A slavish copy of+} the [-things,-] {+methodology of the interview was clearly unsuccessful,+} and [-look at how-]
{+so any theme and variation on that would almost certainly share+} the [-perceptions shift from person-] {+same fate. I had+}
to [-person.

There’s no detail too trivial for this discussion. Because I’ll be using-] {+reconsider what question+} it {+was that I was trying+} to [-look at what other people will be doing.-] {+answer.+} In [-this,-] the [-theory-] {+first survey, the
question developed into, “With a self-constructed SDFN, can you articulate your own
philosophies of data, information, and knowledge?” The respondents presented a very
straightforward answer: “No.” The essence+} of the SDFN is [-not deeply explored. The important thing to

do before-] {+in+} the [-start-] {+process+} of {+categorization.

Although+} the [-process is-] {+interview length lent itself+} to [-gently explain-] {+a thorough exploration of+} the [-process-] {+self-declared
roles+} and [-diagramming
techniques that will be employed in-] {+their own data transfers,+} the [-rest-] {+essence+} of the [-interview. As the participants tend
to be unsure at this stage,-] {+SDFN was in enticing categorization
of many different, and distinct, flows.

I realized that+} it [-is also important-] {+was possible+} to [-avoid giving them definitions-] {+remove person-specific flows and allow people
to classify a general set+} of {+scenarios. I wanted to explore a specific question: “How
does a specific role categorize+} data, information, [-or knowledge as they may be looking for specific cues to suggest which
philosophy-] {+and knowledge.” The question+} of [-data to use.

In this SDFN, I-] {+role
was tricky, despite the success of the demographics section; the participants’ answers

73+}

did not [-ask the participant if-] {+suggest which role headspace+} they [-wanted-] {+were considering their answers from. A
hypothesis, while creating this, was that people would have different answers+} to [-do an entity dictionary, I
just started with-] the [-process of articulating-]
{+categories depending on+} the [-entities. It is acceptable if-] {+role in which they were thinking at the time-an explanation
substantiated by+} the {+remarkably different interview answers one+} participant
[-is chatty during this process. Not only will this help-] {+gave when
interviewed twice about remarkably different topics. I needed+} to [-define-] {+assess+} the [-universe-] {+person’s
role, rather than just his or her generalized demographics while keeping the results
completely anonymous. As the scope+} of [-discourse,
and establish them-] {+the prior project was+} in [-their own minds as subject-matter experts, but also-] {+many ways its fatal flaw,
minimalism was+} the [-process-] {+rule+} of
[-being chatty is allowing them to slip more deeply into-] the [-role they are discussing.

Interviewer: This is literally trying to render how you perceive-] {+day in+} the
[-game. ... We’ll start-] {+second attempt.

The survey opened+} with [-a circle. How would you like to label this
circle? What do-] {+“This survey has requested that+} you [-think is a representation-] {+answer it from the
perspective+} of [-you? We can write-] {+one of the jobs that+} you
[-here, we can write-] {+do. Please describe+} the [-computer here.

Participant: We can talk about me as a Clan Master. I’d put-] {+duties of+} that [-one
there. That’s to start with. I’d like to-] {+job (in
general).”. Earlier, I asked participants to: “We believe that people can+} have [-another one, for my-] different
[-roles. Cause I’m also a player of the game. Which is different from their
role as a Clan Master for sure. Because-]
{+philosophies, depending on what job+} they’re [-often in conflict.

Interviewer: What other entities can-] {+doing. For this survey+} we [-identify in general?
Participant: Across the whole game?
Interviewer: Well, that will transmit data, whatever that is, or information or knowledge. When I say data, feel free to assume I’m also talking
about information or knowledge if-] {+ask+} that [-helps.

Participant: That’s good. Cause often, if-] you [-get too transfixed on-]
{+think about the scenarios from the perspective of one of+} your
[-own view-] {+jobs.” The phrasing+} of [-data, jeez, there’s lots. Like-]
the [-developers. You’ve got
individuals within there. Now, I guess this-] {+first sentence was unfortunate, invalidating the survey’s “scientific reliability.” It+}
is [-when-] {+my belief that+} the [-granularity
comes out, because you can talk about other clan masters as a circle.

But they’re individuals amongst themselves. So I can identify. Within
that, you have-] {+question solicits all necessary demographic information without
extending beyond+} the [-concept of a clan master. There’s [Active Clan Master
1] but then they have other concepts such as –
Interviewer: [Active Clan Master 1] is a person, yes?
Participant: Person, yeah. You’ve got active CMs, which [Active Clan
Master 1] can be part-] {+participant’s comfort zone+} of {+anonymity.

The survey questions after+} this [-group. And you’ve got inactives.

Interviewer: Inactive CMs?
Participant: Yeah. So there’s individuals, but within there,-] {+point all had the same format. They would begin
with: “I am trying to understand what+} you [-could
break that. And then say: "Well, look [Active Clan Master 1]’s here, or

something like that. And [Clan Master 2]’s here. We’ll often talk about
semi-active as well. There’s me-] {+think of+} as [-a thing and there’s also others within,-] {+Data,+} and [-break it down like that.

Interviewer: So what we’ll want to do here is create some sort of representation so that-] {+why. The questions
below ask+} you [-can talk about classes-] {+to categorize the scenario, and then explain the categorization. Please
read the following one sentence scenario. Categorize the highlighted word or phrase in
context+} of [-people. Or individually
people if you feel-] {+the scenario.”
Then the scenario is presented. Here are all the scenarios in order. The scenarios
were chosen such+} that [-they’re important-] {+the highlighted phrase would help+} to [-be talked about as an individual. So,-] {+differentiate between the
three constructions of data found during the interviews. This strategy was not particularly effective.

With minimalism in mind,+} the [-next natural bubble is “other clans.”-] {+first survey was completely reinterpreted.+} The [-other aspect-] {+final
section+} of the [-SDFN that I-] {+first survey, which asked people to write an essay on their own conception
of data,+} was [-teaching-] {+removed,+} the [-participant about here-] {+demographics section+} was {+reduced to one question, and+} the [-appropriate scope of an entity as well as-]
{+flow diagramming was reduced to simple categorization.

While people were quite willing to answer+} the [-desired granularity of their universe of

and some actions are too trivial to diagram.


The mistakes of figure 6.6 illustrate-] {+stated
earlier, I feel that+} the [-participant demonstrating a misunderstanding of-] {+initial questions distracted from and reduced peoples’ attention
span for+} the [-SDFN, drawing their own hierarchy of authority within their organization.-] {+subsequent survey.+} The [-creation of these side artifacts as part of the entity diagram-] {+only demographic question that really matters+} is [-acceptable, especially
as-]

The new survey asked participants to “vividly imagine”+} a [-way of pinpointing desired levels of granularity-] {+role, thereby artificially
putting them into that role’s mindset. Asking participants to engage+} in [-entities. Participants should not
think of the SDFN as-] a [-hierarchy.

The start-] {+specific mindset
is effectively asking them to play a role: to pretend to think in ways that are foreign to

and then to there (Player bubble.) And that is true because I don’t talk
directly to them, per se.


I start by exploring-] {+two sentences why you categorized+} the [-entities-]
{+scenario+} that [-we described in-] {+way.” This phrasing offered participants+} the [-entity diagram along with
a process that has come about out of small talk. The process of diagramming a single
process is-] {+choice to engage in as much
self-reflection as they wanted+} about the [-right complexity for an SDFN. As we can see,-] {+only critical thing that mattered:+} the [-advent-] {+act+} of
{+categorization. While it would have been desirable to have+} a [-second
SDFN in Case-4 meant-] {+more comprehensive survey,
I feel+} that the [-process of “rezzing-] {+second survey incorporated+} the [-fort”-] {+lessons learned from the first and+} was [-a little too simple. It costs

nothing-] {+able+}
to [-make a second diagram if there is sufficient time remaining.

The other important element is the requirement-] {+produce some surprising results, regardless+} of [-asking questions.-] {+its small scope.+}
The [-point
of the interview is-] {+audience for this survey was chosen very informally from three roughly distinct
groups. The first group “chosen” was from my social networks via Twitter and Facebook.

This group was initially contacted+} to [-tease out-] {+pilot test+} the [-understanding-] {+survey. The power of social networking
tools in this kind+} of {+research cannot be overstated.

As+} the [-participant, and to do that,
they have-] {+first few results came in, the survey looked sufficiently effective at capturing
the participant’s understanding of data+} to [-keep talking. Open questions, confirmations, and other prompts keep them
talking-] {+launch it+} without [-guiding down them any specific direction.


6.5.2 Bubble Diagram Analysis
Participant used-] {+modification. The second
group consisted of+} the [-term information-] {+respondents+} to [-describe a communication of meaning. In this
interview,-] the [-term was used-] {+flyer * sent+} to [-describe communications of “status.” In-] the [-sense of

84-] {+INTELST Forum, a mailing
list coordinated by+} the [-diagram, status is ambiguous. Because-] {+U.S. Pentagon and Army. The+} people [-describe their status-] {+who responded+} to the [-people
in charge, it is a communication between people and not-] {+flyer
were then e-mailed+} a [-technical communication.

Yet it is also the game reporting the status of the data representation of the player-] {+link+} to the [-player. Supporting this, the term “information” describes communications-] {+survey. Very little can be said about this group, save+} that
{+they+} are
[-explicitly privileged above data.

Participant used-] {+all active or retired intelligence professionals from both+} the [-term knowledge to refer to expertise. Knowledge can be
shared-] {+military+} and [-is asserted to be a communicable view-] {+civilian
side+} of [-reality.-] {+things.+} The [-players in charge of the-] {+responses from this+} group [-of players explicitly engage in knowledge sharing,-] {+were fascinating,+} and [-impart that view-] {+clearly reflected a
personal construction+} of [-reality
to their apprentices.

Participant, in the bubble diagram, seemed to use-] data [-to refer to contextless
communications. These communications can originate-] {+different+} from {+that of the others.

The third group was recruited through+} a [-computer or a person, but
they fall into two significant categories: activity causing and unprivileged.

In-] {+presentation at+} the [-activity-causing context, participant described communications-] {+company, summarizing
the findings of my interview research and inviting participants+} to [-people-] {+take the survey. Unlike
the more focused set of my “initial trial” group, a large subset of researchers+} and [-computers. While communications-] {+staff+}

7 Interviews
This chapter presents redacted but raw transcripts from+} the [-group are also data. They
seem to be contextless and simple instructions. There seems to be a different ontological
structure between commands to-] {+interviews I conducted at+}
the [-game-] {+company. The SDFN is a novel methodology. As an untested methodology,+} and [-commands to-] {+as+}
the [-players, despite-] {+experiments and “analysis” were+} both
[-being described as “data.”
The unprivileged communications context seems to be attached to communications where-] {+conducted by me,+} the [-senders cannot know what they-] {+transcripts+} are [-talking about. In a sense, such a
communication must be viewed with skepticism: it is-] a [-minor or inferior form of information without reliability. In this context, it describes communications from apprentices to-] {+useful
check for+} the [-people-] {+reader. I appreciate the great length of these transcripts and offer excerpts+}
in [-charge. Participant believed they do-] {+my reflections in the next chapter for readers+} not [-know enough to offer information.


As such, their communications are-] {+interested in excruciating detail.

The excruciating detail is necessary, however, for readers interested in potentially
implementing my methodology. Not+} only [-data, explicitly described as “opinions” that-] do
[-not have any basis for action.

The bubble diagram suggests that the participant has two different understandings
of data simultaneously and suggests no way to reconcile the two.


6.6 Conclusion
This section explored-] the [-methodologies I used to collect-] {+raw transcripts provide a second perspective on my methodology, but they demonstrate my elicitation techniques through+}
the [-data that will be analyzed-] {+act of recording rather than my synthesized instructions as found+} in the [-next-] {+previous+}
chapter. [-The methodology should be completely usable outside-]
{+Fundamentally,+} the [-context-] {+success or failure+} of {+this elicitation method must be decided
by+} the [-philosophy of data as a way-] {+reader, not simply through my analysis+} of [-understanding categories and shared meaning
between different people *.


As-] {+the results I obtained. This chapter,
therefore, occurs before my reflections in+} an [-extension of-] {+attempt to provide+} the [-SDFN,-] {+reader an unbiased
look at+} the [-survey and its-] {+material which informs my subsequent analysis.

The redaction+} process {+sought to eliminate all identifiable nouns, some verbs, and
most positions from the text. All+} of [-categorization of tiny
scenarios may also serve as-] {+these items have been replaced by curly braces,+} a [-useful methodology-]
{+descriptor like noun, or verb, and a number. The number is consistent+} for [-probing X-Phi. My discovery-] {+every instance+}
of
[-people’s utter disinterest in reading more than three sentences as part-] {+that term, allowing the reader to note patterns+} of [-any given
survey question-] {+terms without necessarily needing
the initial terms themselves. Each diagram has undergone the same redaction process as
the interviews, though their quality+} may [-help to shape future surveys even outside-] {+suffer significantly from+} the [-context-] {+reduced page size.

Each interview is ordered by the rough groupings+} of [-X-Phi. On a
more positive and pragmatic note,-] the [-two techniques complement each other, but do
not use-] {+reflections chapter, with
interviews taking+} the same [-methods of asking questions: they provide elements of triangulation
and backup for each other.

The SDFN construction proceeds-] {+order+} in [-three stages: an introduction,-] {+each chapter. This ordering is intended to support

readers flipping between chapters to check assertions or their hunches against my reflections. This order, however, is not+} the [-iterative formation-] {+chronological order+} of the [-bubble diagrams, and an optional theoretical interview.-] {+interviews, as that is
being intentionally obscured to help protect anonymity.

The iterative formation of the SDFN is also quite simple. The participant identifies a

they do-] {+them, which

until the universe of discourse is adequately explored.

7 Analysis
This chapter presents an the analysis of the evidence gathered by my interviews and
surveys. I will explore whether or not my methodologies have demonstrated different
philosophies-] {+discuss more.

Yeah, there’s context+} of [-data-] {+knowledge,+} and [-if they are capable of exploring philosophies-] {+there’s context+} of [-data-] {+data. Maybe+}
in [-the first
place.

deeply, you go, ’Oh, hang on.’ It’s not just making arbitrary distinction
that this+} is [-an examination of my research paradigm-] {+knowledge+} and [-approaches,

looking at the philosophical basis of my conclusions.-] {+this is data. Think about, “Why do+} I [-employ an abductive * approach
to iteratively define universes of interest, rather than applying inductive or deductive
approaches.-] {+consider
that knowledge? Why do+} I [-am testing two questions of interest, which guide-] {+consider that data?” That really is knowledge
because its stuff I know not just there You’re doing+} the [-course of my analysis:
whether people have different philosophies of data and whether my methodologies can
discover someone’s philosophy of data. By guiding-] {+Ph.D.

Interviewer: Well, yes, but I’m doing+} the [-abductive research process with
these two questions of interest, I may be able-] {+Ph.D. based on what you tell
me. So, when we’re building this data flow diagram. What I’m going+} to [-limit my conclusions-]
{+be doing is two symbols. Well, we’re going+} to [-the most simple-] {+be making circle symbol+}
and [-credible story possible from the evidence.

Using the questions of interest as-] a [-guide, I-] {+circle symbol+} will [-iterate over the results of a recursive
analysis-] {+have some sort+} of [-every interview and survey, looking-] {+designator that is important+}

looking at their statements about data and the relationships they suggest between data
and information and-] {+you in it. It represents a person, or an entity, that communicates,
transmits, verbs, data. Whatever you consider+} data [-and knowledge. The evidence suggests-] {+to be.

Participant: Does+} that [-I have successfully
answered both questions of interest by demonstrating-] {+include knowledge?
Interviewer: Does it include knowledge?
Participant: Point Taken.

Interviewer: And then are going to be arcing lines sometimes with an
arrow on it to another entity. The arcing lines we’ll label with whatever
you would classify+} the [-existence of three philosophies-] {+data/knowledge/information, whatever term
you want to do. It’s, for example, you said that there was a ’fail res’. As
an example I’m not sure you would use this, one transmission+} of data [-that emerge from both-]
{+would be you to+} the [-surveys and-] {+server, res+} the [-interviews. The success of-] {+fort. We would label+} this [-research

server, rez fort.’ And if you want to, you could say+} this [-shares similiarities-] {+is data, or that
this isn’t data, this is information. Whatever you think is important to
define about that transmission. We’ll label that line as.

Participant: Oh, so are they different classifications?
Interviewer: There are whatever classifications you want. What I’m
going to be doing here, is looking at how you classify these things, and
what small groups you identify and how you think that other people
classify these things. And then compare it+} to {+how other people classify+}
the [-inductive strategy,-] {+things, and look at how+} the [-approach looks more-] {+perceptions shift from person+} to [-suggest
boundaries-] {+person.

There’s no detail too trivial for this discussion. Because I’ll be using it+}
to [-a region of possible answers and less towards finding (inducing)-] {+look at what other people will be doing.

do before+} the [-approach used when there-] {+start of the process+} is [-insufficient evidence-] to [-even start guessing [50-] {+gently explain the process+} and [-51].


suggests-] {+diagramming
techniques+} that [-my dissertation offers a foundation for future studies and can-] {+will+} be [-deemed
successful.


7.1 Research Paradigm
The investigation of-] {+employed in+} the [-philosophy-] {+rest+} of [-data is a novel and difficult undertaking for X-Phi;
normally-] the [-processes of X-Phi are used-] {+interview. As the participants tend+}
to [-differentiate between already known theories
within moral philosophy rather than creating evidence for future work.

There are a number of ways-] {+be unsure at this stage, it is also important+} to [-engage in research, science, or scholarship. Many
social science texts first discuss deductive and inductive research methodologies. Induction, the creation-] {+avoid giving them definitions+} of [-generalizations from separate facts-] {+data,
information,+} or [-observations-] {+knowledge as they may be looking for specific cues to suggest which
construction+} of {+data to use.


In this SDFN, I did not ask+} the [-universe-] {+participant if they wanted to do an entity dictionary, I
just started with the process+} of [-discourse,-] {+articulating the entities. It+} is [-not appropriate in-] {+acceptable if the participant
is chatty during+} this [-instance. Through exploring specific instances
in a well-defined context (a-] {+process. Not only will this help to define the+} universe of [-discourse), the researcher may find patterns-] {+discourse,+}
and [-trends. My research lacks a universe of discourse, but seeks to-] establish [-one. The
requirement-] {+them in their own minds as subject-matter experts, but also the process+} of [-pre-determined constraints-]
{+being chatty is allowing them+} to [-guide the inductive act makes it less than
completely suitable for my purposes.

Deductive research takes-] {+slip more deeply into+} the [-opposite approach: it instantiates generalizations-] {+role they are discussing.

Interviewer: This is literally trying+} to [-predict specific observations. The practice of deductive research involves restating
generalized statements about-] {+render how you perceive+} the [-universe and seeing if they match reality. Without-]
{+game. ... We’ll start with+} a
[-priori generalizations, however, deductive research-] {+circle. How would you like to label this
circle? What do you think+} is [-completely inappropriate.

Both of these ways-] {+a representation+} of [-thinking about-] {+you? We can write you
here, we can write+} the [-universe suffer from-] {+computer here.

Participant: We can talk about me as a Clan Master. I’d put that+} one [-critical flaw in-]
{+there. That’s to start with. I’d like to have another one, for+} my
[-case: they require-] {+different
roles. Cause I’m also+} a [-known universe-] {+player+} of [-discourse. The inductive methodology requires-] {+the game. Which is different from their
role as+} a [-rough idea of what observations to care about and which to discard. The trouble
with exploring-] {+Clan Master for sure. Because they’re often+} in [-what amounts to a new field is-] {+conflict.

Interviewer: What other entities can we identify in general?
Participant: Across the whole game?
Interviewer: Well,+} that [-there is no established context
with which-] {+will transmit data, whatever that is, or information or knowledge. When I say data, feel free+} to [-sort out inductive and deductive observations. As such, my methodology
primarily uses an abductive paradigm. A process-] {+assume I’m also talking
about information or knowledge if that helps.

Participant: That’s good. Cause often, if you get too transfixed on your
own view+} of [-rapid hypothesis formation and

honest curiosity. My intent here-] {+data, jeez, there’s lots. Like the developers. You’ve got
individuals within there. Now, I guess this+} is [-to narrow down-] {+when+} the [-possible answers to questions of-] {+granularity
comes out, because you can talk about other clan masters as a circle.

But they’re individuals amongst themselves. So I can identify. Within
that, you have+} the [-philosophy-] {+concept+} of [-data, exploring to indicate potential future research directions rather
than absolute facts.

As this-] {+a clan master. There’s [Active Clan Master
1] but then they have other concepts such as –
Interviewer: [Active Clan Master 1]+} is [-an abductive research process into-] a [-largely unexplored area, it should
not-] {+person, yes?
Participant: Person, yeah. You’ve got active CMs, which [Active Clan
Master 1] can+} be [-described as science,-] {+part of this group. And you’ve got inactives.

Interviewer: Inactive CMs?
Participant: Yeah. So there’s individuals, but within there, you could
break that. And then say: "Well, look [Active Clan Master 1]’s here,+} or
{+something like that. And [Clan Master 2]’s here. We’ll often talk about
semi-active as well. There’s me+} as [-scholarship [52-] {+a thing+} and [-53]. Instead,-] {+there’s also others within,
and break+} it {+down like that.

Interviewer: So what we’ll want to do here+} is [-research, using
scientific tools, into the nature-] {+create some sort+} of [-people’s beliefs-] {+representation so that you can talk+} about [-the world. It does not rely on
creating objective statements (science) nor does it rely on citing authorities to explain
the world (scholarship).


7.2 Questions of Interest and the Methodology of Analysis
My “hypotheses” are described as questions of interest to reflect the rapid iterative nature-] {+classes+} of [-abductive explorations. They provide research directions-] {+people. Or individually
people if you feel+} that [-act-] {+they’re important to be talked about+} as [-broad guides-] {+an individual. So, from this, you can say, “Well, this is a communication from me,+}
to the [-formation-] {+active Clan Masters.” “And I do this sort+} of {+communication.” “Or,
this is+} a [-universe of discourse for future research rather than predictive
statements about reality.

The intent of-] {+communication from me to [Active Clan Master 1].” Whatever

represents what you’re doing.

Participant: Look, cause sometimes – Well,+} the [-questions-] {+information we can talk
about, what, information, data?+} is [-to frame my analysis and its objectives and, as such,
guide my analysis towards useful and interesting areas.-] {+transmitted. That’s why+} I [-need to explore how the evidence relates to these questions-] {+sort+} of [-interest.-] {+did
them separately. Cause+} I {+want to transmit me and [Active Clan Master 1]+}
will [-apply these questions when interpreting
the results of the recursive analysis-] {+talk about something differently than we’ll talk about with others
here. That can be a slightly different form+} of [-each interview-] {+communication with these+}
and {+with that. You deal with+} the [-raw evidence from each
survey.

Each interview, after transcription, was subjected to recursive analysis: I summarized six to ten lines of each interview-] {+individual differently even+} in a [-one-line summary. Then between three and
six summaries were summarized, filtering for statements about-] {+group.

Interviewer: And that’s what I’m trying to tease out here. Thank you.

We’ve got you as a player, you as a clan master,+} the [-philosophy of data.

Although self-transcription transmits personal bias, two significant factors prevent-] {+Devs. Right now,
we’re just going to make bubbles and we’ll take these bubbles to+} a
[-traditional double-blind study. An untested methodology-] {+third
page when we’re drawing lines. This+} is [-no place for the mass uti-

lization-] {+brainstorming.

Participant: We’ll keep it sort+} of [-volunteer interviewers. The limited scope allowed-] {+then at a higher level.

Interviewer: Whatever you want to do, if you want+} me to [-retain control of the
interview process and-] {+draw it, I’ll
draw it. If you want+} to [-provide for the best possible interviews-] {+draw it, go+} for [-each participant
while retaining the basics-] {+it.

Participant: Nah, you might as well do it. So there’s other CMs then, as
part+} of the [-SDFN. Because I conducted each interview, the bias would
have already been introduced; providing for pious-sounding human coding would have
lent false reliability-] {+clan. And, I’ll use that term+} to [-something inherently subjective.

Computer-based coding was also tried against the received interviews. However, it
ran into-] {+classify all+} the [-problem of needing to understand-] {+people that
can rez+} the [-meaning behind paragraphs rather
than words or sentences. Current computer technology is-] {+fort, per se.

Interviewer: Okay, so you define Clan Master as someone who’s+} able to [-match-]
{+rez+} the [-frequency
of words-] {+fort?
Participant: Well, not really. But I’ll group them together. There’s what
we call Martini admirals+} in [-sentences. However, as all participants used-] {+[Clan] which aren’t Clan Masters per se, but
they have almost+} the [-terms “data, information,
and knowledge” it would-] {+same power as a clan Master. They can’t+} be [-difficult for any kind of computerized frequency analysis
(even sophisticated ones) to produce useful statistical measures of philosophical meaning.

Human coding runs into-] {+kicked.

But I’ll group them together. Because they’re really, as you know in
[Interviewer’s Clan]. There’s either those at+} the [-abductive research problem-] {+top and there’s the
rest+} of [-not knowing what to look or
code for. However, further research will certainly utilize more exacting scientific tools
with this research as a foundation.

My analysis-] {+the players. So I’ll call that other clan masters. And then there’s
other players. That’s probably an easier, higher level distinction up
there. And the next natural bubble+} is [-very simple.-] {+“other clans.”

The other aspect of the SDFN that+} I [-have tried to extract each participant’s intuitions-] {+was teaching the participant+} about [-data from-] {+here was+}
the [-recursive analysis. Each interview describes a given participant’s
philosophy-] {+appropriate scope+} of [-data, hindered only by confidentiality constraints.


7.2.1 Question-] {+an entity as well as the desired granularity+} of [-interest 1: Do People have different philosophies-] {+their universe+} of
[-data?
If this research produces nothing else,-]
{+discourse, as+} it [-must investigate whether people have different
philosophies-] {+is bounded by both scope and detail: only so many actions are+} of [-data. This idea was the central intuition that prompted this research,-] {+interest,+}
and [-its testing will demonstrate whether or not there is anything-] {+some actions are too trivial+} to [-my intuition.

As the organizing factor of my analysis, this question-] {+diagram.

The mistakes+} of [-interest will focus my

activities. It will justify-] {+figure ?? illustrate+} the [-creation of-] {+participant demonstrating+} a [-philosophy-] {+misunderstanding+} of [-data from my experimental
results, or else its demonstrable failure will justify not doing so.-] {+the SDFN, drawing their own hierarchy of authority within their organization.+}
The [-question “Do people have different philosophies-] {+creation+} of [-data?” defines an overly
large universe-] {+these side artifacts as part+} of [-discourse, one impossible to study at-] {+the entity diagram is acceptable, especially
as+} a [-useful level-] {+way of pinpointing desired levels+} of granularity in
[-one research project.-] {+entities. Participants should not
think of the SDFN as a hierarchy.


88+}

The [-very breadth-] {+start+} of the [-question precludes-] {+SDFN can be quite subtle. In figure 7.2,+} the [-determination of
any useful and specific facts about-] {+rezzing+} the [-world besides simple exploration of-] {+fort SDFN
began as a “walk me through+} the [-assertion
that people have different philopsophies of data. The intent of this research and of
this question is to generate interest in-] {+process:”
Participant: So+} the [-research of-] {+next would be – Maybe if I described+} the [-philosophy of data and to
demonstrate that there are questions to research.

To generate interest in-] {+process ...

Interviewer: Walk me through+} the [-field,-] {+process.

Participant: Well,+} this [-analysis must test whether more than one
philosophy of data exists. The demonstration must show that interesting philosophical
questions surround data. These philosophical questions ask about the inherent nature
of data as well as about how we know something-] is [-or-] {+the case. I say “It’s time clan war.” This+} is [-not data.-]
{+where+} I {+bring in the extra bubbles.

Interviewer: Let’s trace this and see where we get off these bubbles
from the process.

Participant: We’re at clan war. “I+} want to [-see if, beyond my intuitive insight, people actually have different philosophies of data or if my perception of different philosophies is an artifact of-] {+rez+} the [-requirements-gathering process of designing a database. It is therefore not sufficient-] {+fort.” A command+}
to [-state
that people have different understandings of data depending on whether they are dealing
with it in a technical or scientific context. We must look for evidence.

This question of interest, in its reach, is not ambitious. It suggests no predictions
about peoples’ philosophies of data, how they act with different philosophies, or any
other fact about-] {+rez+} the [-world. Instead,-] {+fort,+} it [-simply directs us-] {+sends me back. Now, I guess+} to [-see if there is anything of
interest for further explorations.

This thesis does not explore how-] {+introduce+} the [-philosophies of data interact,-] {+other
bubble here+} as {+other clan members.

Interviewer: So, we’re going to say internal clan members? Can we say
other than members because+} that [-is a future
research goal. While modeling the same scenario-] {+conflicts with clan master?
Participant: Clan Players?
Interviewer: Players. ICP.

Participant: I’ll leave you+} with [-different people was part of my
original intent,-] the [-inevitable whittling down which-] {+acronyms. I tell them something
now as well.

Interviewer: Now, when you tell them something.

Participant: There’s+} a [-Ph.D. topic undergoes simplified

my aims. The large breadth of the interviews-] {+lot. That’s a really detailed line between us+} and
{+Interviewer: Do we want to multiple lines?

7.2.2 Question of interest 2: Can my methodology probe people’s philosophies-] {+process+} of [-data?
My methodology has-] {+rezzing the fort, which is+} a [-simple job:-] {+common
thing we want+} to [-assess what people mean when they use the term
“data.” While-] {+do.

Interviewer: So shall we label this rezzing+} the [-previous question of interest-] {+fort?
Participant: So I’m telling them, I’m sending them information. That
they can now war. That they can start.

Interviewer: And so this+} is [-primarily concerned with establishing
interest or the criteria for interest in what may eventually be-] a [-new discipline,-] {+what? Is+} this
[-question of interest is designed as-] a [-sanity check. I am investigating an unknown field
with an untested methodology. It-] {+status,+} is [-vital to consider that the success or failure of Question
of interest 1-] {+this a command,+}
is [-directly modulated by the success or failure of Question of interest 2. The
methodology itself deserves distinct analysis.

The methodology, as described in the previous chapter, should be of use-] {+this something else?
Participant: It’s information because it does require context. But it’s
like a status it’s saying: “you can now war. We can start fighting.”
Interviewer: So it’s a status. What other flows do you have+} to [-more
people than just those investigating-] the [-philosophy of data. If the methodology is useful
and judged-]
{+internal clan players?
Participant: Apart from that? We obviously maintain that they’re sending stuff back+} to [-add value-] {+me.

Interviewer: What are they doing there?
Participant: The line going back. They’re sending me, also status updates. Whether they’re ready+} to [-Question of interest 1, analysis of the methodology should
indicate-] {+play,+} whether [-other people could use it to investigate matters of interest-] {+they’re there. How much
AP they have and things like that.


Interviewer: And they’re sending you these as?
Participant: Textual information.

Interviewer: So it’s text information?
Participant: Received via MSN.

Interviewer: Do we want+} to [-them.

Question of interest 2-] {+have MSN here or+} is [-asking: do-] {+MSN not at this level?
Participant: No, MSN is at that level. I’d say it is. I see MSN as – it’s true,+}
these [-results make sense? Sense-making-] {+would in essence, I don’t see them as MSN. MSN+} is a
[-matter of internal and external consistency. This question should force me to explore
whether the SDFN correlates with interview results and whether the types of results make
sense relative to the survey.

Beyond consistency,-] {+like a tool
or a spanner. As an intermediary because+} I [-must also ask: Is-] {+send+} it [-possible-] {+here (MSN bubble)
and then+} to [-get these results from this
methodology? In this case,-] {+there (Player bubble.) And that is true because+} I [-need-] {+don’t talk
directly+} to [-make sure that-] {+them, per se.+}

I [-am not reading imaginary meaning-] {+start by exploring the entities that we described+} in the [-tea leaves-] {+entity diagram along with
a process that has come about out+} of [-the results. Because this kind-] {+small talk. The process+} of [-external self-reflection-] {+diagramming a single
process+} is [-difficult,-] {+about+} the
[-question must be simplified to: Do-] {+right complexity for an SDFN. As we can see,+} the [-results surprise me? If they do not have elements

94-] {+advent+} of [-surprise, then the probability-] {+a second
SDFN in Case-4 meant+} that [-I am projecting meaning into them must be strongly
considered.

All of these are very self-critical questions, as they must be to explore-] the [-impact-] {+process+} of
[-an untested methodology. I am trying-] {+“rezzing the fort” was a little too simple. It costs

nothing+} to [-consider whether my methodology can present-] {+make+} a [-persuasive story, and-] {+second diagram+} if [-it can, does it?

7.2.3 Hierarchies-] {+there is sufficient time remaining.

The other important element is the requirement+} of [-Data
In my analysis, two significant and pre-established relationships-] {+asking questions. The point+}
of [-data to information
and knowledge are present: Ackoff’s and Tuomi’s. While not every-] {+the+} interview [-or survey
articulates a hierarchial relationship between data, information, and knowledge, it-] is
[-clear that Ackoff’s work has entered-] {+to tease out+} the [-“common knowledge”. A number of interviewees
discussed a hierarchy of data first promulgated by Ackoff. While they never cite his
influence, their descriptions of relationships between data, information, and knowledge
match his quite precisely.

Interestingly, this hierarchy has a management basis, rather than one grounded
in philosophy or practical-] understanding of [-how we appreciate and use data. There
are many signs of cognitive dissonance between what is perceived as-] the [-traditional
hierarchy-] {+participant,+} and [-how data-] {+to do that,
they have to keep talking. Open questions, confirmations, and other prompts keep them
talking without guiding down them any specific direction.

Interviewer: So what we’ll want to do here+} is [-used in practice. Ackoff has updated his hierarchy many
times, including a book “Management F-Laws” [54] wherein he not only states-] {+create some sort of representation so+} that [-“to
managers, a pound-] {+you can talk about classes+} of [-wisdom is worth an ounce of understanding” but also belabors the
useless metaphor with the extension-] {+people. Or individually
people if you feel+} that {+they’re important to be talked about as+} an [-ounce of wisdom-] {+individual. So, from this, you can say, "Well, this+} is [-worth “65,536 ounces
of data.”
Tuomi presents-] a [-more philosophically rigorous philosophy of data in his cyclic
hierarchy, with data feeding into information, which in turn feeds knowledge, which

provides the ability-] {+communication from me,+}
to [-collect more data. In-] the [-analyses,-] {+active Clan Masters." "And+} I [-will refer to-] {+do+} this [-as-] {+sort of communication." "Or,
this is+} a [-cyclic
hierarchy.


7.2.3.1 Ackoff’s Traditional Hierarchy
The traditional hierarchy linking data,-] {+communication from me to [Active Clan Master 1]." Whatever
represents what you’re doing.

Participant: Look, cause sometimes – Well, the information we can talk
about, what,+} information, [-knowledge, and wisdom in a strict
hierarchy-] {+data? is transmitted. That’s why I sort+} of [-dominance-] {+did
them separately. Cause I want to transmit me+} and [-importance was created by Ackoff [55] in 1989. In-] {+[Active Clan Master 1]
will talk about something differently than we’ll talk about with others
here. That can be+} a [-summary-] {+slightly different form+} of [-his work, Bernstein notes [56]:
Ackoff was a management consultant-] {+communication with these+}
and [-former professor of management science at-] {+with that. You deal with+} the [-Wharton School specializing-] {+individual differently even+} in [-operations research
and organizational theory. His article formulating-] {+a group.

Interviewer: And that’s+} what [-is now commonly called the Data-Information- Knowledge-Wisdom hierarchy (or
DIKW for short) was first given in 1988-] {+I’m trying to tease out here. Thank you.

We’ve got you+} as a [-presidential address to the
International Society for General Systems Research. This background
may help explain his approach. Data in his terms are-] {+player, you as a clan master,+} the [-product of
observations,-] {+Devs. Right now,
we’re just going to make bubbles+} and [-are of no value until they are processed into a usable
form-] {+we’ll take these bubbles+} to [-become information. Information-] {+a third
page when we’re drawing lines. This+} is [-contained in answers to
questions. Knowledge, the next layer, further refines information by
making “possible the transformation of information into instructions.

It makes control-] {+brainstorming.

Participant: We’ll keep it sort+} of {+then at+} a [-system possible” (Ackoff, 1989, 4), and that enables
one-] {+higher level.


Interviewer: Whatever you want+} to [-make it work efficiently. A managerial rather than scholarly perspective runs through Ackoff’s entire hierarchy, so that “understanding” for him connotes an ability-] {+do, if you want me+} to [-assess and correct for errors, while
“wisdom” means an ability-] {+draw it, I’ll
draw it. If you want+} to [-see the long-term consequences-] {+draw it, go for it.

Participant: Nah, you might as well do it. So there’s other CMs then, as
part+} of [-any
act and evaluate them relative-] {+the clan. And, I’ll use that term+} to {+classify all+} the [-ideal of total control (omnicompetence). While a scholarly perspective on this hierarchy might prioritize-] {+people that
can rez+} the [-processes of inquiry and discovery, Ackoff does-] {+fort, per se.

Interviewer: Okay, so you define CM as someone who’s able to rez the
fort?
Participant: Well,+} not [-account for
them.-] {+really.+} But [-his concept of omnicompetence,-] {+I’ll group them together. There’s
what we call MA in [Clan]+} which [-refers to “the ability
to satisfy any and every desire” (Ackoff, 1989, 8), does encompass the
satisfaction of user-defined needs.


In this ontology, data are subjective observations. Curiously, despite data being
subjective observations, Ackoff does not suggest any need for filtering (a common theme
in subjective/observation philosophies of data).


7.2.3.2 Tuomi’s Cyclic Hierarchy
Tuomi’s philosophy is simple and counterintuitive: knowledge is a framework of-] {+aren’t Clan Masters per se, but they
have almost+} the

[-96

world from which we build information. Information provides-] {+same power as+} a [-local framework from
which to extract data from-] {+clan Master. They can’t be kicked.

But I’ll group them together. Because they’re really, as you know in
[Interviewer’s Clan]. There’s either those at+} the [-world. Thus,-] {+top and there’s+} the [-apex-]
{+rest+} of the [-hierarchy is data, which-] {+players. So I’ll call that other clan masters. And+} then
[-filters downwards to modify knowledge and information. This approach represents-] {+there’s
other players. That’s probably+} an
[-abductive approach towards-] {+easier, higher level distinction up
there. And+} the [-philosophy of knowledge-] {+next natural bubble is "other clans."
Interviewer: So I’ve got other clan players,+} and [-the philosophy of data-] {+then other clans?
Participant: Um. No, I would put them together, so just other clans.

Interviewer: What about other clan masters? Or is that other clans?
Participant: I would put them+} as {+just other clans at+} the [-hypotheses being tested-] {+moment.

Interviewer: What about non-clan players? Are they relevant to this?
Participant: No, they’re not relevant.

Interviewer: Is facebook relevant to this?
Participant: Yes it is actually.

Interviewer: And I will absolutely want to why you think that.

Participant: Yeah, that’s interesting, maybe for our future wrap-up
discussion.

Interviewer: So we’ve got FB, we’ve got other clans, we’ve got other
players.

Participant: So that’s other clan members. They’re like, they’re other
clans. Like [Enemy clan name.] And these+} are [-information, generated from knowledge-of-world,
rather than induced from data points [57]:
The generally accepted view sees data as simple facts that become
information-] {+other clan players in our
clan.

Interviewer: Oh, other internal clan players. And we’ve got other CMs,
Now we have the Devs. Do we want to say battlestations?
Participant: Yeah, I would just assume we’re talking about [game].

Interviewer: No, do we want to have [the game]+} as [-data is combined into meaningful structures, which subsequently become knowledge-] {+an entity?
Participant: As the game? We could do that...

Interviewer: We don’t have to use any of these. We’ve got you+} as [-meaningful information is put into-] a
[-context-] {+clan
master,+} and [-when it can be used to make predictions. This view sees
data-] {+you+} as a [-prerequisite for information, and information-] {+player. Is there anything else you think we will
want to render beforehand?
Participant: In terms of my professional life+} as a [-prerequisite-] {+clan master? No, let’s
go with that+} for [-knowledge. ... [Exploring]-] {+now.


Interviewer: It’s not stuck in stone. Sorry, cast in steel. Let’s start by
diagramming just+} the [-conceptual hierarchy of data,
information and knowledge, showing that-] {+basic+} data [-emerges only after-] {+flows. Where should+} we
[-have information, and-] {+start? Just the
most trivial.

Participant: Well, I guess+} that [-information emerges only after we already
have knowledge.


Tuomi’s conception of a reverse hierarchy-] {+the most trivial+} is [-useful to my research in two significant ways. Obviously, it allows me-] {+between myself and
the game.

Interviewer: And now this is you as
Participant: Me as+} a [-prior idea-] {+clan master+} to [-which-] {+the game.

Interviewer: CM+} to [-compare analyzed philosophies-] {+[game]
Participant: That’s why I was happy to have [the reference to game as
an entity] in there.

Interviewer: So there’s data flowing from you to the game?
Participant: Yep.

Interviewer: Or... stuff? What would you label this as?
Participant: I’d label that as sort+} of data. [-Although Tuomi’s research is not explicitly about-] {+I just send it stuff. It doesn’t
need any context. It’s stuff like "I. Am. Going. To. Rez. The. Fort."
Interviewer: When you say ’stuff’ What do you mean?
Participant: It’s almost like discrete packets.

Interviewer: So, packets of?
Participant: Data?
Interviewer: Commands?
Participant: Like a command. Saying: "I want to do something. I want
rez+} the [-philosophy of data, his
analysis of hierarchies-] {+fort now."
Interviewer: So+} is [-an acceptable complement-] {+it OK+} to [-it. By presenting-] {+label this as commands, or does it encompass
something other than commands?
Participant: It does, sometimes...

Interviewer: So commands and..

Participant: No, that’s true. It’s pretty much just commands. like I
would send it I could do many things but they’re all related to telling
the game to do something. I don’t call it knowledge, because it’s like
it’s just, maybe they’re just talking about context thing. It’s something
fairly simple, discrete. It’s not open for arbitration or anything like
that. It doesn’t require arbitration, just "do it."
Interviewer: Let’s build from here. What other trivial communications
or interactions do we want to label here?
Participant: Well, it would be [game] back to me.

Interviewer: You as Clan Master?
Participant: Yep. That would be - its funny - I’d describe that coming
back as information. It’s telling me that its rezzed the fort or its kicked+}
a [-novel relationship hierarchy, Tuomi challenges-] {+player. it’s just done something. "I’ve promoted someone!"

Interviewer: So you’d say this is information?
Participant: Yeah.

Interviewer: What information are you getting?
Participant: Well it’s information about+} the [-“everyone knows” mentality of much-] {+status+} of [-knowledge
management.

Tuomi’s research into-] {+something within+}
the [-fundamental questions-] {+game
Interviewer: So status information? So you’d be getting communications+} of [-knowledge-] {+status which are information?
Participant: Yes. That’s right. Yeah. "The fort+} is [-one of-] {+now up." I can tell+} the [-fundamentals-]
{+HP+} of [-my research, for he demonstrates-] {+the fort has gone up or+} that [-it is possible to have-] {+someone’s changed+} a [-different
understanding of data from an intuitive-philosophical standpoint. This demonstration
of difference allows-] {+rank.

Interviewer: What other interactions are there in just+} a [-questioning of the nature-] {+trivial level?
Participant: With other bubbles? Or just with [game]?
Interviewer: Let’s elaborate from each+} of [-data-] {+these bubbles+} and [-acts as an external source of
validation for my analysis.-] {+just grow
it.

Participant: So the next would be – Maybe if I described the process ...

Interviewer: Walk me through the process.

Participant: Well, this is the case. I say "It’s time clan war."+} This [-philosophy-] is [-supported by a study of “intelligence” published-]
{+where I bring+} in [-Nature by
McNab and Klingberg [58]:
Thus, high-capacity individuals (who can remember more information
at once-] {+the extra bubbles.

Interviewer: Let’s trace this+} and [-who tend to do better on aptitude tests) might simply be

better-] {+see where we get off these bubbles
from the process.

Participant: We’re+} at [-keeping irrelevant information “out of mind,” whereas lowcapacity individuals may allow more irrelevant information-] {+clan war. "I want+} to [-clutter
up-] {+rez+} the [-mental in-box. The difference may just be a matter of having
better spam filters.

Some of our own recent work on differences in controlling access-] {+fort." A command+}
to
[-working memory has provided evidence favoring this mental spamfiltering idea. In one experiment, measuring electrical signals emitted by-] {+rez+} the [-brain enabled us-] {+fort, it sends me back. Now, I guess+} to [-show that high-capacity people were
excellent at controlling what information was represented in working
memory: they let in information about relevant objects but completely
filtered out that about irrelevant objects. Low-capacity individuals, in
contrast, had much weaker control over what information entered-] {+introduce+} the
[-mental in-box; they let in information about both relevant and irrelevant objects roughly equally. Surprisingly, these results mean that-] {+other
bubble here as other clan members.

Interviewer: So, we’re going to say internal clan members? Can+} we [-found that low-capacity people were actually holding more total
information in mind-] {+say
other+} than [-high-capacity individuals were-but much of-] {+members because that conflicts with clan master?
Participant: Clan Players?
Interviewer: Players. ICP.

Participant: I’ll leave you with+} the [-information they held was irrelevant-] {+acronyms. I tell them something
now as well.

Interviewer: Now, when you tell them something.

Participant: There’s a lot. That’s a really detailed line between us and
Interviewer: Do we want+} to {+multiple lines?
Participant: Yeah. That’s cool What we’re dealing with at+} the [-task.


The idea of consciousness as filter discussed by all of these researchers is not particularly novel, although-] {+moment.

I’m going through+} the [-localization of filtering activities by fMRI to those physical
regions-] {+process+} of {+rezzing+} the [-brain suggests that this ontology has-] {+fort, which is+} a [-closer connection-] {+common
thing we want+} to [-our biological
minds than does Ackoff’s.

of knowledge is this? What kind of activity is it?
Participant: Sharing? Sharing knowledge? It really is sharing. That’s
what+} I [-interviewed had at least-] {+said.

Interviewer: There’s+} a
[-master’s degree in the sciences or the arts. Unfortunately, due to anonymity concerns, I
cannot provide details about each participant in-] {+process of sharing that goes on before and during+}
the [-interviews below, nor can I provide
full bubble diagrams, as-] {+rezzing of+} the [-diagrams can be trivially used to identify some-] {+fort process?
Participant: Yeah. It’s primarily before. It’s certainly part+} of the [-participants. In-] {+thing.

That is not+} the [-interests of preserving as many potentially identifiable bits, I will be using-] {+complete picture. It doesn’t just happen on its own. Even
if it doesn’t happen all+} the [-pronoun “they” to refer to each participant,-] {+time, there’s still a sharing of knowledge
about what’s going on and who’s doing what.


7.1.3 Personal Reflection
The personal reflection for Interview 1 is presented here+} as [-the use-] {+part+} of the [-term “she/he” is too
distracting.

I conducted and analyzed these-] {+expanded discussion around this interview. All other reflections for other+} interviews [-so bias may-] {+can+} be [-present. However, most-] {+found in the
next chapter.


Participant used the term information to describe a communication+} of [-my interaction during-] {+meaning.

In this interview,+} the [-interview-] {+term+} was [-asking open questions. The results should
offer a sufficiently compelling study-] {+used+} to [-provide an investigation for my questions-] {+describe communications+} of
[-interest and a foundation for future, more scientifically rigorous discussions.

To avoid weasel words such as “participant seems,” every interview description

7.5.1 Data as Communications
One-] {+reality. The players in charge+} of the [-three philosophies-]
{+group+} of [-data is that data are encoded signs. Signs-] {+players explicitly engage in knowledge sharing, and impart+} that [-exist on
paper or electronically are passed between humans who may then interpret those signs
as-] {+view of reality
to their apprentices.

Participant, in the SDFN diagram, seemed to use+} data [-for information-] {+to refer to contextless communications. These communications can originate from a computer+} or [-knowledge encoded into them. In this philosophy, data is-] a
[-technological artifact rather than something generated-] {+person, but
they fall into two significant categories: activity causing+} and [-manipulated by humans.

Information-] {+unprivileged.

In the activity-causing context, participant described communications to people+}
and [-knowledge-] {+computers. While communications from computers+} are [-passed using data, but-] {+information, the commands
to the computer+} are [-not of-] {+data to+} the [-same fundamental
nature. The relationship is a container metaphor rather than hierarchical.

The few interviews expounding upon this philosophy suggest that significant research is necessary-] {+game, and explicitly contextless. Data can also be transmitted+} to [-explore its tenets. Beyond that, there-] {+a person and+} is [-some evidence that this
philosophy may be held as-] a [-secondary philosophy when dealing with technological
systems * rather than as a fully-fledged philosophy of its own.


7.5.1.1 Interview I
Technical pilot interview, exploring a Facebook game. Participant holds two philosophies of data: Data as a menial interpersonal
communication and data as a menial technical communication.


The first interview I conducted was a technical pilot, assessing-] {+simple alert designed to cause activity. Curiously, in+} the [-methodology alone without exploring business specific concepts. In this interview,-] {+same
category, messages from+} the [-participant and I explored-] {+players in charge to+} the [-leadership dynamics-] {+rest+} of [-a Facebook Game. More

details about-] the [-bubble diagram-] {+group are also data. They
seem to be contextless+} and [-its analysis can-] {+simple instructions. There seems to+} be [-found in chapter 3, in the case
study. This first interview will offer the raw quotes, as well as the recursive analysis
appropriate-] {+a different ontological
structure between commands+} to the [-section in which-] {+game and commands to+} the [-quote appears, thanks-] {+players, despite both
being described as “data.”
The unprivileged communications context seems+} to [-explicit permission by
participant.

Data, information, and knowledge relate-] {+be attached+} to [-each other. Data-] {+communications where the senders cannot know what they are talking about. In a sense, such a
communication must be viewed with skepticism: it+} is a [-menial category be*

This pattern was also apparent in some-] {+minor or inferior form+} of {+informa-

tion without reliability. In this context, it describes communications from apprentices to+}
the [-surveys like Survey I (p. 131) and VI (p. 140).


tween these three. Data exists-] {+people in charge. Participant believed they do not know enough to offer information.

As such, their communications are+} only {+data, explicitly described+} as [-itself, without reliance on anything else. “Anything
else” here means external signs which frame, or contextualize, data as well as indications-] {+“opinions”+} that [-the data requires judgment or discernment on the part of the recipient. I believe-] {+do
not have any basis for action.

The SDFN diagram suggests+} that the participant [-considers the application of context to be something required of
ambiguity or importance, and therefore of increased importance.

Data is not a function of expertise or knowledge. A critical component of data is
its lack-] {+has two different understandings+}
of [-necessary arbitration:-] data [-is intuitively obvious, objective,-] {+simultaneously+} and [-unimportant.-] {+suggests no way to reconcile the two.


7.2 Interview 2+}
Participant: [-It’s almost like discrete packets.-] {+So we can do a typical Information request for example. It
starts off with somebody asking me a question.+}
Interviewer: [-So, packets of?-] {+Which entities to start with?+}
Participant: [-Data?-] {+Entities as in an individual?+}
Interviewer: [-Commands?-] {+Role entities?+}
Participant: [-Like a command. Saying: “I want to-] {+Let’s+} do [-something. I want
rez the fort now.”-] {+with a position 86 because they’re close.+}
Interviewer: [-So-] {+To you as?
Participant: In my role as an position 87.

Interviewer: There is something... what+} is [-it OK to label-] this [-as commands,-] {+flow?
Participant: That flow could be either a person 1:1 chat or maybe phone
or email+} or [-does it encompass-] something [-other than commands?
Participant: It does, sometimes...-] {+like that.+}
Interviewer: [-So commands and..

Participant: No, that’s true. It’s pretty much just commands. Like I
would send-] {+What is+} it {+a communication of?
Participant: Information+} I {+suppose you+} could [-do many things but they’re all related to telling
the game to do something. I don’t call it knowledge, because it’s like
it’s just, maybe they’re just talking about context thing. It’s something
fairly simple, discrete. It’s not open for arbitration or anything like
that. It doesn’t require arbitration, just “do it.”

Two iterations of analysis produce:
Data-] {+say.

Interviewer: How can we label it? The position 86+} is [-discrete. Data does not need context nor arbitration. Commands
to software are data. Data-] {+communicating
with you Information. What+} is [-simple, it can be executed on its own merits.


For example, instructions for action are data, both those that-] {+the context of this Information? What+}
are [-explicit instructions to software agents and implicit orders as “status updates.” In-] {+they communicating with you?
Participant: They’re asking a question.

Interviewer: So+} the [-game sense,-] {+position 86 communicates with you+} a
[-status update-] {+question. You
would say this question+} is [-a message sent out from administrators to the players “advising them”
on the status of the structure players are defending.-] {+Information?+} This [-“advice,” however, is intended
primarily as a mobilization for action, as positive activity-] is [-needed to create-] the [-structure.


Communications are information. Communications are movements of subjective
statements about-] {+noun 97 we’ll be
doing.

Participant: Just keep prompting me.

Interviewer: Then what happens?
Participant: It depends upon+} the [-world encoded-] {+question. If we do a typical question.

Say they’re looking for research work+} in [-the transmitted signs. Communications must
have context. This categorization of data is used to delineate between communication/
information and data. Beyond-] a [-generalized context, communications must also contain-] {+particular area. It would
mean that I search+} a [-temporal context: they have-] {+particular database.

Interviewer: What entities are involved in you figuring out what database to search?+}
Participant: [-So I’m telling them, I’m sending them information. That
they can now war. That they can start.-] {+That’s from experience I suppose.+}
Interviewer: [-And so this is a what?-] Is [-this a status, is this-] {+there+} a [-command,-] {+flow from one entity to another or+} is this [-something else?-] {+innate
experience?+}
Participant: It’s [-information because-] {+experience.

Interviewer: Is this experience, Data, Information, Knowledge, or other?
Participant: Whether is+} it [-does require context. But it’s
like a status-] {+Data or Knowledge. I suppose+} it’s [-saying: “You can now war.” We can start fighting.


Two iterations produce:
Information can be returned by software. Status is a form of information. There is a temporal aspect-] {+Knowledge
really. Data+} to [-changes in status.

Information requires context. Information provides options.


Expertise-] {+me+} is [-knowledge, being the perception of options for action in information.-] {+not – I say it’s Knowledge.

Interviewer: You use your+} Knowledge [-confers the ability-] {+as experience to find a database.

Is it safe to generalize+} to {+“database” here or shall we+} be [-persuaded by communications as expertise is used-] {+more specific?
Participant: No, database.

Interviewer: What flows are there from you+} to [-frame incoming information and thereby “understand” it.-] {+the database that your
expertise has chosen?+}
Participant: {+The Knowledge is that+} I [-don’t-] know [-how-] {+which one+} to [-class their opinions. Not necessarily
knowledge. It’s almost like data. It’s like, they don’t really send me
commands, not as in the concept that we talked about, commands in
the past-] {+search.

Interviewer: You have internal Knowledge of which one to search. Is
there some sort of confirmation action+} that {+you+} do [-something.-] {+to confirm that
Knowledge or is that tacit?
Participant:+} It’s [-almost like data. They just tell me
stuff. I’ll say, “We’re going-] {+tacit.

Interviewer: you now know which database+} to {+search. What is the first
thing you+} do [-this.” but they’ll say, “I think we should
do this.” I don’t think I-] {+when you+} have {+found that DB?
Participant: You answer that question.

Interviewer: So you send something+} to [-reply to it. It’s like they’re offering
their opinion. But-] {+that database?
Participant: As I said,+} it’s [-where-] {+looking for perhaps a research topic. So+} we’re [-distinguishing the different status.

And then when we go-]
{+going+} to [-active clan masters. Now there’s-] {+that topic request.

Interviewer: From the question you would generate+} a [-number of
different inputs: “Clan status, Info, FB.” Same-] {+topic request.

This topic request – this flow, can be categorized as Data, Information,
Knowledge or other?
Participant: Data.

Interviewer: We start+} with [-all of these. They’re
in-] {+you as position 87 sending+} a [-group, they’re getting-] {+topic request
through data flow to+} the [-same as everyone else. But we’ll have an
extra line-] {+DB. Then what happens?
Participant: You either get a result or you don’t.

Interviewer: Let’s assume the best case.

Participant: You get a result. You get Data+} which will [-definitely be MSN as well ...-] {+then flow back.

Interviewer: So we have a flow backwards+} which [-will-] {+is Data and this is a
result?
Participant: Which would then+} be [-another
input-] {+communicated back+} to [-them.-] {+the position
86.+}
Interviewer: [-So you’re sending them MSN? And what are-] {+Do+} you [-sending
over MSN?-] {+perform a transformation on this result?

99+}

Participant: [-I don’t know? I can call it anything, can’t I? It’s like knowledge? I guess? It really is knowledge-] {+By transformation, if it’s actually a physical entity, you
might actually provide+} that [-I’m sending back-] to [-them that
way. Similarly, they’ll send me back data and opinions via FB messaging.


But they’ll also have that subsequent line via MSN. It’s that knowledge
sharing. Even hilariously in the past, I’ve actually called some of these
guys on-] the [-phone. ...-] {+person. Not just Information, if it
exists like a copy or something.+}
Interviewer: [-Now what are-] {+So one case would be that+} you [-doing over-] {+and the position 86 get+} this [-MSN & Phone?-]
{+result. This is in one case. Are there other cases?+}
Participant: [-Well, that’s the genuine sharing of knowledge. Knowledge
of: “I think this; I want to do this; no, no, no, we can’t do that.” It’s a
collaborative sort of working together. It’s a sort of consensus-building.-] That’s [-where-] {+assuming we’re successful. If+} it’s [-knowledge, because by sharing that knowledge you
can build a common consensus which we can work around. Because if
we don’t share each other’s opinions or experiences-] {+not successful+}
then we [-never build
the consensus-] {+may need+} to [-actually operate, otherwise you’d just-] {+go elsewhere. That would+} be [-individuals
because it, generally as a clan, we have to come up with a consensual
view-] {+the first choice+} of [-everything..-]
{+checking that DB.+}
Interviewer: [-Do we want to have consensus as another line? Or is the
sharing consensus-forming?
Participant: Yeah, the sharing is consensus-forming. We exchange
knowledge-] {+This iterates around+} and [-out of that comes consensus. Even that knowledge is:
“Do you consent to this?” It’s-] {+around until you...

Participant: It might+} not [-really-] {+be+} a [-command but it’s-] {+database, it might be asking individuals
for example. So you go to+} a [-knowledge.


Two iterations produce:
Opinions, lacking privileged status, are not knowledge. Activity provides context. Responses from active members-] {+different source.

Interviewer: Let’s diagram that. Which entity+} are [-classified-] {+you talking to+} as [-knowledge. Responses from semi-active and inactive leaders are data through
opinions.

Knowledge can-] {+a
class.

Participant: It would+} be [-shared. Collaboratively sharing knowledge builds
consensus.


There is no explicit differentiation between-] {+another position 86.

Interviewer: How can we label that other position 86+} different [-kinds-] {+from
this one?
Participant: position 86 B. So I’ve gone down this loop, got nothing.

Then I would contact that person.

Interviewer: Before we go into that, is the getting+} of [-data. There are
examples in which-] {+nothing a+} data [-is either technical in nature (for example,-]
{+flow?
Participant: Yeah it’s+} a [-command to cause
activity) or-] {+flow.

Interviewer: What it’s+} a [-communicative activity (wherein the communication was not produced as-] {+flow of? Let’s start by indicating+} a
[-function of expertise). Data-] {+flow. This+} is [-interesting only in the sense-]
{+basically a null result.

Participant: It’d be a flow back to position 86 A saying+} that [-it represents the mental
activity of-] {+didn’t work.

Interviewer: So we’ve got this null result. Is this null result flow from+}
the [-communicator, not as any kind of thing on which-] {+database+} to [-take action. The
differentiation only extends-] {+you Data, Information, Knowledge or other?
Participant: ??? <From diagram it looks like Data>
Interviewer: Then you perform – you send something back+} to the [-comment that something-] {+position 86?
Participant: It would be Information back to them.

Interviewer: And what+} is [-“sort of data” potentially
representing an internal cognitive dissonance between the two ideas.-] {+this Information?+}
Participant: [-It’s-] {+Information saying “I now will have to actually look further.” That’s+} when [-you’re talking-] {+we start+} to [-another person and they’re passing-] {+look at people like position 86 B.

Interviewer: What covering name can we give to that “look further”
communication? Is it like a status update?
Participant: Yes.

Interviewer: Just to step back for a moment... let me know when there’s
enough. We give a status update back, they may or may not refine+} their [-knowledge of what happened-]
{+question. Eventually you may need+} to [-them and what happened in
the past-] {+talk+} to [-you. So-] {+a position 86. What is it
that+} you [-can either learn from your own experience or

Participant: It is that original question, that original Information.+}
Interviewer: [-Would-] {+Do+} you [-say that there’s-] {+perform+} any [-relationship between
knowledge and data in-] {+manipulation of+} this [-sense? Or is it just...-] {+question?+}
Participant: [-No, I don’t... I think.-] {+Possibly.

Interviewer: What manipulation do you perform?
Participant: It may be just narrowing down. Which could be Knowledge+}
I [-think-] {+know of various... they may have+} the [-expression-] {+wrong year+} of [-data in-] {+the research
project.

Interviewer: Perhaps a refined question?
Participant: Yes
Interviewer: Is+} this
[-context, it’s interesting actually. Now you’ve got me thinking. No, but
yes. Yes, but no. Well, it is sort of, yes. I agree. I don’t often express
some things like certain relations to [the game]-] {+refined question Data, Information, Knowledge,
other?
Participant: Information isn’t it?
Interviewer: You send,+} as [-data. but there
definitely is if you stop and think about it, because. But yes.


Two iterations produce:
Knowledge can be gained from talking-] {+position 87, to position 86 B, a refined question? What do they do?
Participant: They may know it in their brain already or they could refer
me+} to [-other people, learning things
through the game. Experiential Knowledge is what you get from doing
things. You learn from criticism, experimentation, failure. A different
kind of knowledge is-] someone [-else’s experience. Knowledge-] {+else, position 86 C, or they may actually have their own
systems, actually.

Interviewer: This, in a way,+} is [-privileged over data. Represents “knowing” over "observation.


There was no discussion on transformations-] {+atemporal. And, because+} of [-data. Moreover,-] {+that, there’s+}
no [-conclusions-] {+causation. Let’s model the set of normal responses that the other position 86s+} can
[-be drawn-] {+give to you. What flows back are there+} from [-inference, as it-] {+the position
86?
Participant: I suppose one+} is [-equally likely that no transformative framework exists
such-] that [-the standard hierarchy-] {+they cannot help at all: “Dead end.”
Interviewer: Is this Dead End Data, Information, or Knowledge?
Participant: Information. The other one+} is [-present. Each term seemed to-] {+that they may refer you.

That would+} be [-discussed on its own
merits without reference to the others. There are two philosophies of data found here:
data-] {+Information.

Interviewer: referral+} as [-a menial-interpersonal communication-] {+Information.

Participant: Another one is that they check their internal systems, they
may have DBs, something like that,+} and [-data as-] {+provide the answer.

Interviewer: So they are communicating with an entity.

Participant: Let’s say they have their own DB.

Interviewer: They send+} a [-menial-technical communication. In both senses, data contains no privilege over information or knowledge. As
menial-technical, data seems-] {+flow+} to [-be considered-] {+a DB. What are they sending+} to {+the
DB?
Participant: It would+} be [-bits or human instructions rendered-] {+that original question –the refined question.

Interviewer: The refined question+} as [-bits: self-encapsulating orders for action. As menial-interpersonal, data seems to
be expressed observations of-] {+Data, Information, Knowledge?
Participant: It’s Information isn’t it? No, it’s Data, sorry. It’s Data.

Interviewer: Do they perform a transformation on this?
Participant: No, I don’t think so.

Interviewer: And+} the [-world without-] {+DB returns what?
Participant: Something positive, basically.


Interviewer: Could we say it’s the result / null result thing?
Participant: Yes. They get the same,+} a [-knowledge basis: empty words-] {+repeat.

Interviewer: They have a DB result, what then happens?
Participant: They refer it back+} to [-be
corrected and brought in line with-] {+me.

Interviewer: As part of+} the [-consensus formed by more experienced people.


7.5.1.2 Interview II
The participant is an information worker.

Data is-] {+referral or as+} a [-container for human-produced information. Data is the only thing manipulatable by machines.-] {+different+} Information [-and Knowledge cannot-] {+flow?
Participant: It would+} be [-transformed into Data, only
contained.


The participant works with information systems. Data is-] {+the same.

Interviewer: so they get+} a
[-container for human-produced information. Information-] {+hit+} and [-knowledge relate-] {+they refer the hit back+} to [-each other as a function of human
interpretation, integration,-] {+you.

Participant: Yes that’s right
Interviewer:+} and [-analysis. The main function-] {+you perform some sort+} of [-data is as-] {+status update and give them+}
a [-communicative medium of technology.


There is no hierarchy or relationship between data and information. Data is completely different from information or knowledge.

Data does not belong in the hierarchy of Information or Knowledge.

The results of a search are Knowledge, but are formatted and contained
within Data.


These quotes indicate-] {+response. What other entities do they consult? In+} a [-strong differentiation between information/knowledge
and-] {+generalized case?
Participant: The research system? Their own brain? They may talk to
somebody else. And it just repeats.

Interviewer: If they have neither referral nor+} a [-strongly physicalized data. Although information and knowledge are related, the
relationship expressed seems-] {+dead end, is there something else they can send back+} to {+you?
Participant: No, that would+} be [-a function-] {+the end+} of [-analysis and encoding.

Communications between people, as discussed-] {+it, wouldn’t it?
Interviewer: In their expertise they have some answer+} in [-the interview, are clearly information.

Information-] {+their expertise+}
is [-non-physical. It-] {+a referral?
Participant: Yes.

Interviewer: Say they dead end you, then what happens?
Participant: Go back to position 86 A to find out just how important it
is. That’s all to do with the priorities.

Interviewer: How+} can {+we model that flow? Is it part of the Status update
or is it different?
Participant: I suppose it’s status, it would just+} be a [-communication, a conversation,-] {+different priority in
status.

Interviewer: You give them+} a [-story.


Knowledge,-] {+status update. Do they then give you
anything?
Participant: They either say keep going+} or [-personal experience, is encoded in information for transmission to
other people.-] {+they might have a refined
question.+} This [-philosophy requires this encoding because knowledge is not directly
communicable between people. Knowledge guides interpretation of information and,-] {+could go round+} in
[-the case-] {+a lot+} of [-knowledge encoded in information, the recipient’s knowledge must be used-] {+circles.

Interviewer: I’m getting that sense. They send back+} to [-analyze the incoming information-communication-] {+you ...

Participant: Information+} to [-produce new knowledge:
Knowledge is associated with an experience.-] {+say either stop or more+} Information [-doesn’t have-] to [-be read-] {+help
assist.

Interviewer: Can we combine those in one covering statement.

Participant: It’s just a rerequest+} or [-analyzed. Knowledge must be analyzed and used.


Data-] {+continuation – priority.

Interviewer: Because they’re clarifying what+} is a [-container for human-produced information stored in physicalized entities
such as books-] {+priority.

Participant: Yeah, that’s right.

Interviewer: You send them a status update back one way+} or [-computers:
Data is-] {+another.

They prioritize...


Participant: Yeah.

Interviewer: Are there any other entities involved in this noun 97?
Participant: It again depends on the question. If it’s definitely internal.

You stick with internal, you may get+} a [-record-] {+dead end. Or if it’s something+}
that [-can record and contain Information. Records, Data,
are merely physical entities.


As examples of data,-] {+perhaps somebody outside+} the [-participant offers: “Physical containers are pieces-] {+organization might be able to assist
with then you do the sort+} of [-paper
or e-mail. Digital containers are still physical.” With no evidence for-] {+steps with+} other [-interpretations.

In a simple sense, the participant believes that: “Data-] {+people.

Interviewer: You then do position 86 external.

Participant: Exactly, or DB, external. That sort of thing.

Interviewer:+} is [-a bucket for Information and
Knowledge.” To restate: data-] {+there an entity which+} is {+neither+} a [-semiotic representation of and container for content.

Data as semiotic container-] {+database nor a position
86? Or+} is {+there+} a [-strong philosophical stake.-] {+different type of person that’s meaningfully different?
Participant:+} It [-expands beyond the

simple data-as-bits philosophy-] {+could be another position 87.

Interviewer: Let’s model+} that [-may accompany other philosophies of “real” or “raw”
data. The universal application of data-as-container and information-] {+flow. You+} as [-root-of-meaning
suggests that this philosophy extends beyond a simple communicative philosophy that
can be used in conjunction-] {+position 87 A, talk to position
87 B. And what do you communicate+} with [-other philosophies. Rather,-] {+them?
Participant: The refinement –+} it [-strictly defines a role for
data in-] {+would probably be+} the [-storage of signs and relegates it-] {+priority one by
this stage.

Interviewer: Refined question with priority. Information?
Participant: Yes.

Interviewer: And then?
Participant: And then they would do something quite similar+} to {+what I
just done. They would consult+} a [-strictly supportive role with respect-] {+system or an individual.

Interviewer: Same flows?
Participant: Same flows.

Interviewer: If they return, from their sources, dead end or null result.

Participant: Which is possible.

Interviewer: What happens?
Participant: Back+} to
[-meaning. Nor-] {+position 86 A via myself.

Interviewer: What do you get and what+} does [-this philosophy leave any room for data as observation or numerical
representation.


7.5.2 Data as Subjective Observations
The next interviews explore-] the [-nature of data as-] {+position 86 get?
Participant: Not+} a [-subjective observation. These philosophies differ strikingly from the data-as-communications philosophies-] {+lot. But Information though. Or+} as [-they accord
data a place in the knowledge/information/data hierarchy. There is evidence of Ackoff’s
hierarchy-] in [-interview III that contrasts with-] {+0.

Interviewer: What label do we want to put on not+} a [-more cyclic hierarchy in interview IV.

Present in both interviews is the acknowledgment-] {+lot? We can absolutely call it not a lot.

Participant: No result, basically.

Interviewer: And you communicate+} that [-data is inherently subjective,-] {+back to position 56 A through
status update?
Participant: Communication, status update.

Interviewer: If they don’t get no result ...

Participant: Sometimes they’re quite happy. Sometimes they’re just
testing it out. That’s what position 86s... they don’t actually want you
to find anything. Particularly if it’s a patent or something like that.

They go through all+} that

{+103

Interviewer: due diligence.

Participant: But other times they’re very unhappy, so+} it [-is produced-] {+depends.

Interviewer: Besides no result, what would you get+} from [-observations made by people,-] {+position 87 B?
Participant: Probably a bill, an invoice. Just a status update basically
saying they’ve searched this, this, and this,+} and that it [-must be contextualized
with information-] {+hasn’t been
successful.

Interviewer: Do we want+} to {+label this invoice or status update or both?
Participant: both.

Interviewer: Invoice is what?
Participant: It would be data, wouldn’t it? Data, Information, what was
the other one? Knowledge? No. It would be Data.

Interviewer: And they search status update you.

Participant: Which is Information.

Interviewer: What happens if they do find a result
Participant: they do? Then they+} provide [-useful guidance. Data’s lack of inherent value due-] {+the Information as in Data. Or
they may do a status saying we have+} to [-its
subjectivity requires that it-] {+pay them for this part.

Interviewer: So you get search status and invoice one way or another.

Participant: Precisely.

Interviewer: You said you get the Data as Information?
Participant: The status would+} be [-“filtered” so that only-] {+Information,+} the [-most usable aspects remain.


7.5.2.1 Interview III-] {+actual article or
whatever it is is Data.+} The [-participant explored business dynamics
of-] {+result... If we had+} a [-meeting.-] {+result that would be Data.

Interviewer: The search result would be+} Data {+as opposed to no result
which+} is [-the basis of information and knowledge, and formed from observations.


This interview, exploring the interactions of a meeting, was
one of my more theoretical interviews. While most of the
other interviews focused on more technical topics, the communicative/business focus of this discussion provided an

interesting counterpoint-] {+Information. We have external position 87s iterate over that
stuff according+} to the [-other interviews featured in the rest of this analysis. Ob-

servation-] {+priority. Other entities? What do you think
position 86 A+} is [-the fundamental component of data, allowing interpreted data to be useful
information. Information becomes knowledge,-] {+doing+} with [-the hierarchy continuing beyond
knowledge:
Knowledge is-] {+this request?
Participant: They’re+} probably [-not the top-] {+– they could be one+} of the [-hierarchy. Universal truths,
e.g. things called “Laws”-] {+people tasked+}
in [-science,-] {+their team to work this out. There+} could be [-called wisdom (W).


In the interview, the participant began with-] a [-discussion of-] {+team entity over there.

Interviewer: What interactions do you see position 86 A having with+}
their [-opinion-] {+team?
Participant: There would be some sort+} of [-the
relationships-] {+Information communication+}
between [-data, information,-] {+themselves+} and [-knowledge. Later in-] the [-interview, however,
they admitted-] {+team.

Interviewer: Then,+} to {+team, Information.

Participant: It would be the status update.

Interviewer: Do they perform+} a [-change-] {+manipulation+} of [-their preconceptions due to-] the [-interview: “I consider [data
and information]-] {+status update
Participant: They would just convey that Information+} to [-be a hierarchy, but it’s not very clear in my mind” is a comment
made by participant at-] the [-start of-] {+team.

Interviewer: Does+} the [-interview. Later in-] {+team send any flows back to position 86 A?
Participant: They may to – it depends on this loop, doesn’t it. It may
have happened to get that priority for example. To say yes it was important to keep going. Then we went through this loop down here.


Interviewer: So is+} the [-interview,-] {+team prompting A to send priority? Does A
manipulate+} the [-participant
observed that participation-] {+team’s prompt?
Participant: They stick it+} in the [-SDFNproduced-] {+e-mail for+} a [-change of understanding of data:
Coming into-] {+month or so and wait.

Interviewer: That actually is a manipulation. It’s checking informally
“is+} this [-interview,-] {+important?”
Participant: Don’t know. They may or may not.

Interviewer: If they don’t, there’s nothing here. If they do?
Participant:+} I [-thought that the hierarchy-] {+wouldn’t know unless it+} was [-Data, Information, Knowledge with maybe Wisdom or something above that. Or
something crazy like that. Way-] {+in the trail from an e-mail, for
example. They’ve sent it+} out [-there. During-] {+and they sent+} the [-meeting,-] {+original team’s response
back, then+} I [-think
I... with your... non-directional coaching, you helped me to see where
things were probably Data, where those Data were used by others to
form Information. And then, pieces of Information, there’s something
higher above information.


Structured and organized data, as delivered for a persuasive argument, becomes information. Data-] can [-be transformed into knowledge directly, such as-] {+decide what they’ve done. But otherwise, I don’t know
if they’ve manipulated or not.

Interviewer: What is your guess here?
Participant: Guess is that they don’t manipulate.

Interviewer: so there is+} a [-scientist predicting
movement with Newton’s first law-] {+flow from team to you+} of [-motion. In-] {+priority. But there
is also+} a [-prediction of-] {+flow from A to you for sending this. But+} the [-future as information,-] {+impetus for+} the [-predictor has to take data (observations-]
{+question is always from A.

Participant: it looks like a bit+} of [-something happening), and input them
into knowledge (a scientific model). Interestingly, data also encodes information and
knowledge as well as forming the basis of those two concepts.

Knowledge is the theoretical basis of understanding-of-the-world. Two people discussing-] a [-simple mechanical operation-] {+mess. That’s what some days+} are [-communicating information, but the theory
driving that discussion is knowledge. Furthermore, the jargon used-] {+like.

You go around+} in [-that discussion
also represents knowledge, whereas a generalized description is “somewhere between-] {+circles.

Interviewer: Something slightly different. We have+} data {+flows to+} and [-information.” Thus, an understanding of the state of-]
{+from+} the [-art-] {+DB system+} and the [-status quo

is knowledge of what is possible or effective-] {+invoice. Are there any Data flows in that
zone?
Participant: There would be if it turned out+} to [-do. Operation of effective management
practices is also knowledge, despite-] {+be... we haven’t finished
off+} the [-management theories themselves not being
transmitted. Because-] {+– we’ve gotten+} the [-knowledge-] {+result.

Interviewer: Do you perform a manipulation+} of [-effective management inspired the communications to modify behavior,-] the [-communications themselves are knowledge, representing
the practice of those theories.

Information is data structured for-] {+search?
Participant: Maybe in+} a [-purpose. Structured, organized data as delivered for-] {+tiny way. Putting it in+} a [-persuasive argument becomes information just as an historical-relationship
context-] {+format so that it’s more
acceptable to us here.

Interviewer: Which+} is [-also information structured for purpose. Data becomes information by a person
or machine collecting data and then “drawing something out of it.”-] {+absolutely manipulation. What shall we label
this manipulation as?
Participant:+} Just [-as information-] {+formatting isn’t it?
Interviewer: Formatted search result, which would happen with any of
these entities.

Participant: Yes.

Interviewer: This formatted search result+} is {+Data, Information, or Knowledge?
Participant: It’s Data.

Interviewer: Is there+} a [-structuring-] {+flow+} of [-data, the participant suggests that knowledge may-] {+Knowledge at any point in this noun 97.

Can there+} be a [-structuring of
information.

Data is an observation. A listing of daily events is a data-] flow [-just as a progress
update is data. Nonverbal cues between people across-] {+of Knowledge?
Participant: It could be from position 86 B? or it could be from the
position 87. So we’re assuming here that they’re searching+} a [-meeting table, such-] {+system.

They may,+} as [-eye contact-] {+I said, just be searching their tacit Knowledge.


Interviewer: Then they would communicate?
Participant: That’s right. Write it,+} or [-arm movement, also constitute data. When one of the meeting participants aggregates
the nonverbal cues to supplement persuasive mechanisms, the participant considers-] {+pop it in an e-mail,+} that [-aggregation-] {+sort of
thing.

Interviewer: If position 86 B is communicating back+} to {+you. What shall
we label this Knowledge flow as?
Participant: It’s just their Knowledge isn’t it? Their experience.

Interviewer: So their experience?
Participant: Yeah.

Interviewer: What about Info Broker B?
Participant: Yes, I suppose it could+} be [-data.

Another example-] {+Knowledge there. It depends
on – I’m thinking+} of [-data is-] {+specific Information questions. They’re more like+}
an [-intuitive insight, a “moment of clarity,” into the fundamental nature-] {+intermediary that I’m thinking+} of [-a problem. “Data gathering” is used-] {+position 87 B+} in {+that they may
have gotten Knowledge from somewhere else, but they themselves,
that entity, no. It’s not+} the [-context of an experiment
differently than the term “data” alone, with few relationships in common between-] {+Knowledge, it’s just+} the
[-two. “Experimental data”, unlike normal “data”, can have different levels of quality: “we
can classify the data better if-] {+Data.

Interviewer: Can+} we [-can see it clearer.” There seems to be little support for
data as encoded information or knowledge.-] {+assert that Info Broker b would just have position
86 Bx.

Participant:+} The [-resolution-] {+sort+} of [-cognitive dissonance in this interview suggests that the SDFN can
be used as a way-] {+external systems similar+} to [-reconcile a participant’s theoretical understandings-] {+these internal.

Yeah.

Interviewer: But they themselves wouldn’t. They would just pass –
Participant: Intermediary.

Interviewer: You are then the recipient+} of [-categories with-] their [-everyday use. This consequence, while useful in-] {+experience qua Knowledge. What do you then return?
Participant: Right, OK. Then I either just relay it. Or if it’s too technical,
I actually get them to talk to each other.

Interviewer: That sounds like two different flows. Flow+} the [-exploration-] {+first is that
you’re relaying it. What is the flow here between you and research A?
Participant: It’s just an exchange+} of [-philosophy, can

also-] {+Data.

Interviewer: It’s just formatted search results?
Participant: That would+} be [-useful-] {+it.

Interviewer: You’re formatting Knowledge+} as a [-practical way-] {+search result.

Participant: That’s right.

Interviewer: And that’s Data?
Participant: Yes.

Interviewer: Or? You are referring B+} to [-resolve “silos”-] {+A.

Participant: Yes.

Interviewer: Would this fall under formatted search results+} as {+well?
With just different formatting? Or is+} it {+substantively different?
Participant: It’s just Information. Isn’t it? Not that much, no.

Interviewer: It’s just Information?

Participant: Yes.

Interviewer: What Information is going?
Participant: Just Information saying yes, I do know where that ... contact.

Interviewer: This+} is {+obviously+} a [-way-] {+superposition of many generalized
cases. Are there any other common avenues of exploration in this?
Participant: No, that’s good enough for that particular topic.

...

Interviewer: Let’s move+} to [-change-] a [-participant’s
understanding of the items under-] {+more theoretical+} discussion.


[-7.5.2.2 Interview IV
This participant engaged-] {+You label
yourself,+} in [-multiple interviews, producing
quite a lot of evidence and strong elaboration-] {+one+} of [-their ideas.


The participant is-] {+your roles, as+} an [-engineer. Data are
subjective observations ﬁltered by knowledge
and localized into information.


There-] {+position 87. To you, what+} is {+Information?
Participant: It’s something that’s not physical, basically. That means
it could be+} a [-cyclic hierarchy of data as observations, localized
by information, and filtered by knowledge, becoming information and knowledge. Knowledge then directs the gathering of the next cycle of information. There are no obvious
demographic characteristics to explain the strong subjective nature of this participant’s
views, though they seemed-] {+communication, it could be a conversation or a story.

Something verbal.

Interviewer: So Information is any non-...

Participant: Data+} to [-engage more strongly with databases than did those-] {+me is physical, basically. It’s an entity that filters??
an entity+} of some [-of the other participants. More study of the sources of philosophy of data-] {+sort.

Interviewer: You would say that letter+} is [-required.-] {+Data?
Participant: I would say that letter is Data. But what is on that+} Data is [-used both-]
{+Information. Just to be a bit confusing.

Interviewer: Tell me more.

Participant: Coming from the field we’re in,+} in [-singular and plural senses, data can have qualities,-] {+Libraries+} and [-measurement generates a data point.-] {+Record
group 130. You’ve got different areas. It would be, as I’ve said,+} Data [-relates to information and knowledge in a cyclic
hierarchy *, such that some assertions about-] {+or
record. That’s just+} the [-world (knowledge) form a context within

which to view data. “Knowledge filters data, which produces information, which produces knowledge. The acceptance of new knowledge-] {+physical entity.

Interviewer: Data+} is [-predicated on extant filters.”
One example-] {+a container...

Participant: Yes,+} of [-context modulating-] the [-nature of data-] {+Information.

Interviewer: And Information+} is [-the understanding-] {+content+} of {+what type? Is there something common to all Information?
Participant: it’s not easy. I’m struggling.

Interviewer: Frankly, this is why I’m doing my PhD
Participant: It’s+} a
[-sensor’s purpose changing the observer’s interpretation-] {+struggle. Information, what is Information? It’s just...

No, I’m drawing blank.

Interviewer: We have right now Data
Participant: And then+} of [-the data produced by that
sensor. In this understanding, background education-] {+course you get Knowledge.

Interviewer: We have Data, Data+} is a [-primary contributor-] {+container for Information.

Participant: I’m quite happy with that.

Interviewer: You say physical at some point?
Participant: Yes, physical in t??. It doesn’t actually have+} to {+be physical
in+} a piece of [-data’s context.

Information’s localization-] {+paper, but it can be physical as in an e-mail message.


Interviewer: Physical as real?
Participant: Yeah, physical as in real.

Interviewer: Except that doesn’t really help.

Participant: What about in terms+} of [-data from-] {+semiotics.

Interviewer: Is there some sort of semiotic connotation or denotation
of data? So this is Data containing+} the [-“study-] {+Information+} of the [-issue at hand” helps-] {+entities we
described.

Participant: Yes.

Interviewer: Container is actually+} the
[-*

Reminiscent-] {+correct word.

Participant: I think so.

Interviewer: Because it gets fuzzy+} of [-Tuomi’s philosophy (page 96).


recipient to understand-] what the [-data means. Information emerges from a contextualization-] {+nature+} of [-data: “In order-] {+the container
is.

Participant: Yeah.

Interviewer: We have Information.

Participant: Information is ... Was talking about Knowledge. Knowledge+} to {+me is more than just Information. If we go backwards perhaps.

Knowledge, you actually+} have [-context [within] which-] to [-understand data, background
education (knowledge) and the study of the problem at hand (information) must be combined.” Knowledge and information represent different levels of understanding,-] {+associate it+} with
[-knowledge formed by integrated conclusions versus the ordered and contextualized data
of information.

Understanding in this case is-] an [-awareness of applicability. All data, information,
and knowledge interact with mental models of the worlds. Locally true items are information, whereas knowledge informs models that are more global. Because the generation
of knowledge-] {+experience.

Interviewer: So Knowledge+} is [-a function of incoming filtered data, we sometimes get conflicts in explanations:
Explanation-] {+experiential?
Participant: Yes. Whereas Information+} is [-contextualizing [models] for specific circumstances. Explanations should expand knowledge. Sometimes they contradict understanding, potentially due to cultural factors-] {+just there. It’s provided nobody actually read it+} or [-mistranslation.-] {+analyzed it or anything like that. Whereas+}
Knowledge [-filters for meaningful data,-] {+has been more analyzed+} and [-data-] {+used. And I’m getting very
vague.

Interviewer: Knowledge+} is [-contextualized from information
into information. Contextualizing knowledge frameworks allow for an understanding
of incoming data by situating that data within knowledge. The framework does so by
providing a relevancy filter for incoming data:-] Information [-is more concrete – in-] {+which has been analyzed?
Participant: Yes, yes that’s right. It’s+} the [-hierarchy. Data is concrete.-] {+next step up,+} I [-measured-] {+view+} it [-via a defined process at-] {+as.

Interviewer: Analyzed and used Information. Can there be+} a [-particular time. We might argue what
it means, which is knowledge, but it-] {+– Knowledge+} is [-what it is. But the information
... I’ve reviewed a whole pile of things. Those are information sources,
it’s clear-] {+experiential. This experiential Knowledge allows us to do what?
Participant: That’s+} how [-I obtained them. They may be wrong, their provenance
may not be certain. Data is specific, discrete. Information can be-] a
[-collection of data.


It is the process of collecting-] {+doctor knows how to operate, basically. It’s
because they’ve had Information,+} and [-localizing data which turns data into information.

This set of localized data is contextualized, which increases relevance at-] {+they’ve analyzed it. So that’s+} the [-same time
that it increases potential error or subjectivity. Despite claims of concrete data, data-]
{+tool for them to operate. It’s like somebody else coming+} in
[-this philosophy must-] {+with just
having some Information. But they don’t have the actual analysis or
expertise. Which seems to+} be [-subjective: it is filtered from human observations. However,-] the

[-114

self-reflection of-] {+Knowledge+} that [-subjectivity creates meta-data about reliability and thereby filters
for useful data.

Data is a discrete observation. Discrete data means-] the [-ability to specify “what,
where, when: would define-] {+surgeon has.

Interviewer: So+} a [-piece of that, what-] {+surgeon has expertise about+} the [-measure of it was,-] {+world,+} and [-its location
at-] {+his expertise about+} the [-time.” Data has a specific provenance and reliability. Data-] {+world+} is [-treated as if-] {+Knowledge.

Participant: Expertise about his Job, world, whatever.

Interviewer: Can this expertise about his or her job be verbed into
Information?
Participant: I suppose+} it {+could be?
Interviewer: which verb?
Participant: I don’t know?

Interviewer: But there+} is
[-atomic, despite the ability-] {+a movement back.

Participant: Yes.

Interviewer: Is there a movement from Information+} to [-perform different, closer observations of the same thing.

The presence of the term “filter,” one of the most important keywords that-] {+data?
Participant: No, not in my view.+} I [-found,
suggests that-] {+view+} data as [-observation is produced from any observation of the world-] {+something completely
different.

Interviewer: We’ve got up+} and [-is
thus-] {+down arrows [between Information and
Knowledge] but we don’t have an arrow there [to Data]. We have Data
as+} a [-subjective construction, tied to the observer, rather than evidence of the world.

Participant: Yes, as a bucket, in my mind, whatever.

Interviewer:+} of [-knowledge.-] {+Information or Knowledge?
Participant: and/or Knowledge
Interviewer: so there’s a difference in nature or kind between+} Data
{+and these other two. But not between these two [Information and
Knowledge]
Participant: No, these two get fuzzy.

Interviewer: Information+} can be
[-formed-] {+turned+} into [-data sets, which may-] {+Knowledge?
Participant: Information can+} be [-evidence of a somewhat local scientific language
translating between purely subjective data-] {+turned into Knowledge.

Interviewer: Through analysis+} and {+use?
Participant: Yes.

Interviewer: Knowledge can be turned into Information through what?
Participant: I suppose it depends on who uses it basically. It’s+} the [-“reliable” data-] {+user
of that. It’s somebody with ... not that. But what it was. Its like it’s
been+} that [-some scientists
demand. Relationships between sets are information.

There is no link to technical data-] {+level of ... It’s like dumbed down+} in {+a way. Somebody reads+}
this [-philosophy. Representations of data (bits)
are not-] {+and they’ve got+} the [-thing. Categories of representations are meta-data-] {+Knowledge, but somebody else reads it+} and [-bit streams are merely
representations of data. “When people can attach meaning-] {+it
doesn’t make sense+} to [-bit-streams,-] {+them, it’s just Information. Because+} they [-can
become information. Normally glyphs become information, but when they’re just representations of data (like the ’A’ signifying a part of the base pair in DNA) they’re still
data.”

7.5.3 Data as Facts
Philosophies in this category tend to be more scientifically oriented, representing data
as only-] {+don’t
have...

Interviewer: Where is+} the [-results of careful consideration-] {+sense making component here?
Participant: I don’t know.

Interviewer: The first question is: is there an external sense-making
component?
Participant: I don’t know what you mean.

Interviewer: If I’m reading that,+} and [-measurement. Here, data as facts orient
the observer to-] {+I’m+} a [-recorder-of-measurements, rather than as someone who must filter

observations or interpret semiotic encodings.

This category of interviews is the largest, as can be expected while interviewing-] {+lawyer,
Participant: that’s right, OK.

Interviewer: Versus that and I’m+} a [-scientific research establishment; because of the scope-] {+painter with no Knowledge+} of the [-interviews,-]
{+law.

Participant: That’s where+} I [-probably
missed some significant nuances. Exploring-] {+would say that+} the [-different constructions of data-] {+painter would just be
reading that,+} and [-fact
from a philosophy of science standpoint could-] {+it would just+} be [-extremely productive.


7.5.3.1 Interview V-] {+Information to them. But the lawyer
would then become Knowledge. Because they would read into it their
experience or whatever.


Interviewer:+} The [-participant is a scientist. Data are measured observations, objective reﬂections-] {+lawyer would apply his or her Knowledge? Or incorporate that into his or her Knowledge?
Participant: Would incorporate that into.

Interviewer: So that’s part+} of the [-world. Information is-] {+analysis
Participant: Yeah.

Interviewer: say you’re teaching someone as an apprentice. Is there+} a [-product-]
{+flow+} of [-human
thought to contextualize that data.


In strong similarity to Interview I, the participant differentiates between what can be understood by consciousness and
what is in the realm-] {+any+} of [-machines. The participant is a highly
theoretical researcher,-] {+this sort+} in [-contrast with some-] {+that kind+} of {+teaching?
Participant: Teaching you would start off with+} the [-more

pragmatically trained participants. Data are specific and measured observations.

Data, information,-] {+Information,+} and [-knowledge are ordered categorically in terms of precision.

Information is an unconfirmed interpretation of data-]
{+they would through the exercises+} and [-knowledge represents understanding of-] the [-real world. The flow from specific-] {+training, it would be ... their
Knowledge.

Interviewer: You would cause them+} to [-general is interesting, especially
when considering the implications of the participant’s philosophy of data.

Data are measured observations, with observations or raw measurements as “raw
data,” and interpretations of data-] {+develop
Participant: Knowledge. Their Knowledge, yes.

Interviewer: You’re not communicating Knowledge to them.

Participant: No they have to do something+} to {+create the Knowledge.

Interviewer: would it+} be [-data-as-“interpreted data.” Experiments return
data as numbers collected by various instruments, but data-] {+safe to say that Information+} is [-also embodied in the world.

Geometry and design-] {+some sort+} of [-equipment and the operational set points are data. “Equipment
geometry and operational set points are embodied data.” The idea-]
{+vehicle for Knowledge?
Participant: Yes.

Interviewer: What kind+} of [-data embodied in-] {+vehicle is it?
Participant: It’s+} the [-real-] {+primary vehicle, really.

Interviewer: So Information+} is [-a strong feature of-] the [-data-as-facts philosophy.

There must-] {+way that Knowledge is communicated?
Participant: Yeah.

Interviewer: Can Knowledge+} be [-an observer-] {+communicated? Say you’re talking+} to [-manipulate things-]
{+position 87 B,+} outside of [-data because, “[The]
experiment itself is not a conscious entity;-] {+this context, as equals. Can+} you [-cannot send anything but data to it.” While

it is interesting to consider information and knowledge as functions of consciousness,
the distinction between data as embodied or observed seems to belie my assessment-] {+ever give them
a flow+} of [-“data as measured observations.” If data is allowed to be embodied in the physical
universe, then to retrieve the data and thereby to understand the object is-] {+Knowledge that’s Knowledge a opposed+} to [-perform
some sort-] {+a flow+} of [-structured and measured observation-] {+Knowledge
encoded+} in [-the context of an experiment. The
participant notes that data are “raw numbers and no context.” This philosophy requires-] {+Information?
Participant: I’m not sure.

Participant: I suppose – you do assume+} that [-data must be understood as the fundamental relationships-] {+they have a level+} of [-matter that can-] {+Knowledge, so yes, it would+} be
[-observed and quantized.

The category-] {+an interchange. You’ll start to use, perhaps,
jargon or something, assuming they know what you’re talking about.

Interviewer: Let’s talk about jargon. What is jargon?
Participant: Jargon, I suppose, would be a special language between
specialists.

Interviewer: A verbal shorthand?
Participant: And each discipline would have its own.

Interviewer: Jargon is what?
Participant: Just a cryptic way+} of [-information trades precision-] {+exchanging Information.

Interviewer: Jargon is a cryptic or short way of–
Participant: A shorthand

Interviewer: a shorthand+} for [-context.-] {+Information.

Participant: between specialists.

Interviewer: that’s not a Knowledge exchange.

Participant: No, it’s+} Information {+exchange.

Interviewer: Can there be a Knowledge exchange without using Information?
Participant: I’m still, I don’t know. There probably+} is [-an unconfirmed interpretation-] {+but I can’t think+}
of [-data. There-] {+examples.

Interviewer: Say I’m writing my dissertation. Clearly, because I’m typing into a computer, Data+} is {+the container, yes?
Participant: Yes.

Interviewer: Am I typing my Knowledge into+} a [-clear distinction between-] {+computer, or am I typing
my Information?
Participant: You’re typing your Knowledge. Because you’ve been through+}
the [-objectivity-] {+noun 97+} of [-data-] {+filing the Information.

Interviewer: So I’ve collected Information through whatever,+} and {+I’ve
got all+} the [-interpretation/necessary subjectivity-] {+Knowledge that I’ve got. The noun 97+} of [-information.

It’s-] {+putting Knowledge
into a Data container, that does+} not {+touch Information? Or does it?
Participant: I don’t know. As you say, you could+} just [-raw numbers ... but-] {+be putting it in
there,+} it’s not [-knowledge because-] {+Knowledge,+} it’s [-the
experiment and a very contrived environment.... It is interpreted data
about the contrived environment.


This interpreted data-as-information is-] {+just word for word from somebody else.

You’re+} not [-knowledge because-] {+relating+} it [-does-] {+or transforming it or anything. So you’re+} not [-represent a phenomenon of-]
{+adding to it. As I said, if I come back to+} the [-object under consideration. Data produced as part-] {+feeling that Knowledge has
been added to.

Interviewer: As you know I’m going to be transcribing this recording.

The noun 97+} of {+me typing this recorded conversation falls where in
this?
Participant: It’s Information. It just depends upon if you make any
changes. If it’s+} a [-simple
experiment, does not form the basis of action-] {+straight word for word, that’s just Information because
you haven’t altered it+} in {+any way.

Interviewer: So our communications are Information.

Participant: Yes.

Interviewer: It’s recorded on+} the [-real metalworking area.

Experimental information (or interpreted data)-] {+computer+} as {+Data.

Participant: Yes.

Interviewer: Me typing it would just be changing+} the [-product of simple experiments may not conform to the real world. However, information may form the basis of
understanding of the real world.-] {+Data container?
Participant: yeah. That’s right
Interviewer: Because it’s just+} Information, [-combined with a statement of “I think
you should do this” (classified as knowledge) may allow design engineers-] {+because there’s no analysis
or use.

Participant: By the time it gets+} to [-create new
designs. Flows of information wholly contain “raw data” *-] {+your thesis, it turns into Knowledge.


Interviewer: Which I’m encoding into Data. But other people pick up a
conference paper I generate from my thesis+} and [-its explanation, whereas
an independent flow of data would be subject-] {+theoretically read it.

That conference paper,+} to [-external interpretation.

Participant:+} It [-may be formed from personal
experience, but may not-] {+could+} be [-about “unreal things.” An unreal thing is “Information,

because it’s not a real thing yet.-] {+either.+} It’s [-not knowledge about a real device.-] {+more Information.+} It’s [-still a
hypothetical.”

7.5.3.2 Interview VI
The participant is an Information Architect.

Data are facts produced from instrumentation
and sensors.-] {+initially+}
Information [-is multidimensional
data.


The participant is one of the information architects that I
interviewed. They explore the implications of computerized
data. However, in contrast with other interviewed information workers,-] {+until+} they [-clearly articulate data-] {+choose+} to [-be facts exported

from measuring instruments. Although there are elements of contextualization here,
the view-] {+do something with it. Until it adds to
their armory+} of [-data-] {+whatever their skill set is.

Interviewer: Really, Information can produce Knowledge, but Knowledge can produce Information because someone is communicating
their Knowledge to you+} as [-records of measurements indicates a different philosophy when compared-] {+Information and it’s not until you analyze it
that it becomes their Knowledge.

Participant: Yeah. That’s what it seems+} to {+be.

Interviewer: Could it be that+} the [-other information specialists *. More research is necessary-] {+Knowledge+} to [-explore how
interactions with technical devices shape philosophies of data.

There-] {+Information bit+} is {+abstraction?
Participant: Oh yeah.

Interviewer: If I’m communicating through+} a [-strong relationship between information-] {+conference paper to you,
my Knowledge, but you’re getting it as Information, I’m abstracting
our my use+} and [-knowledge:
An example-] {+analysis+} of [-information is a time series trend. An example-] {+it, i.e. my internal tacit Knowledge. Can we
think+} of [-knowledge is advice (expert correlates information, presents-] a [-suggested
course-] {+better word than abstraction?
Participant: No.

Interviewer: I want to make sure I’m not putting words into your
mouth.

Participant: That’s OK. There’s no word there at the moment.

Interviewer: Final question. We have Data, Information, and Knowledge. First, is there anything to either side+} of [-action).-] Information {+or Knowledge?
Participant: Not that I+} can [-be provided to support decisionmaking. Examples of information: Train timetable, an index of crime
levels.


There are suggestions-] {+think+} of [-a relationship between knowledge and data: “Sensors

The [-participant is a scientist. Data are numbers formed from data points. Clearly articulates Ackoﬀ’s hierarchy.

Data are numbers, and only numbers. “Data is a multi-dimensional collection-] {+position 100+} of
[-data points. A data point is a number.” As well as “Data plus analysis creates information.

[-science.

Information is-] {+interesting stuff
there. It was fine, I did never fight with+} the [-basis of action and-] {+position 101, we both fought
others together.

Interviewer: So we’ve got the position 100, we’ve got...

Participant: So there was+} a [-container for data: “Information are instructions to perform work of a specific nature, guidance into what it is they’re going to
test.” Information is what allows humans to judge between different outcomes: to order
one product over another because of scientific results contained within the information.

Those results, interpreted and packaged, are data. Although-] {+group 104 that+} the [-participant uses-] {+position 100 was+} the
[-container metaphor here, information is not acting as-]

Interviewer: Let’s look at this interaction. Did you send anything to+}
the [-contextualization of information is explicitly differentiated from-] {+group 104?
Participant: I sat among+} the [-pure numbers
of data, rather than data being transformed into information.

Data, analyzed into information, may create novel information. Novel information
can generate knowledge. Knowledge is-] {+group 104. We’re talking about+} a [-predictive model of the universe, “based on

acting on information received, can create meaning or knowledge:
Knowledge is a model derived from analysis of information. You analyze data-] and [-generate new information. New information can generate

for data and knowledge.”
Knowledge is transmittable experience: “Knowledge is perception of something,
what you think you know.” Experience manifests as intuitions-] {+noun 111 this
way. People were suspicious+} and [-requests for specific
data are an expression of encoded knowledge. In one example, the participant transmits
a request for an image to the database: “I would be sending-] {+thought+} that [-knowledge, even if the
DB doesn’t acknowledge it.” Knowledge is transmitted-] {+he was taking more cues
than were actually+} in the [-act of using knowledge,

Interviewer: Let’s look at+} the [-sender’s knowledge, rather than-] {+very trivial equipment verb 52. You as

Participant: What we within+} the [-recipient’s

Interviewer: Would you say that this proposal+} is {+Data, Information,
Knowledge or something else?

Participant: Probably Information.

Interviewer: so the group 104 sends to the group 105+} a [-quality. It mixes with data and knowledge. Something-] {+proposal+} that [-you relate, it goes from one source to another. Any kind of data or

Thus, information-]
{+Information.

Participant: It+} is [-more than-] {+probably Information noun 95ed to persuade the group.

It’s not Data, it’s brought together somehow. You mightn’t agree.

Interviewer: The thing is, I’m+} a [-simple container, and may seem-] {+passive receptor. I by definition agree.

Does the group 105 send anything back+} to [-be an intrinsic building block of data-knowledge interaction-] {+the group 104?
Participant: The group 105 will either agree+} with the [-world. Information seems to
equate to semiotic ideas, as-] {+proposal or not
agree with the proposal or do nothing.

Interviewer: Are these separate flows, or is+} it [-can-] {+a response flow?
Participant: It’s a response flow. Typically there would be two ways of
doing this, there would+} be a [-representation-] {+formal way where there’s a meeting where
the decision was taken+} or [-transmission agent. In strong
contrast to-] {+there would be a less formal way.

Interviewer: Are they different?
Participant: The result would be pretty much+} the [-philosophy of-] {+same.

Interviewer: Is+} the [-data-as-communication camp, information is communication.-] {+result,+} Information, [-being formed of signs, requires interpretation for the extraction of

Participant: I dunno. We’ll go with Information at this stage.

Interviewer: Don’t feel compelled+} to [-computers and humans, respectively.

Data are factual representations-] {+choose Information just because+}
of [-measurements. They usually form numbers,
but, “Information is text and data is numbers, but even text-] {+the other two.

Participant: It+} could be [-data. Text as data-] {+Knowledge, I suppose.

Interviewer: What’s the best fit?
Participant: I’m struggling with these definitions in my own mind.

Interviewer: If we’re struggling with the definitions we can do a theoretical conversation if you think that that would help you more or I
can continue poking your intuition.

Participant: Let’s go intuition. You might discover what I actually think
along the way.

Interviewer: group 104 position 100, what+} are [-descriptions-] {+they sending you?
Participant: I think mostly Data.

Interviewer: what is one+} of [-measurements.” The fundamental characteristic-] {+the Data flows they send to you?
Participant: There’s lots+} of [-data is that it is-] {+stuff about just+} the [-factual product-] {+daily occurrences, progress.

Interviewer: Are daily occurrences data?

use+} the [-same time,-] {+word Information, it’s just what’s happening.

Interviewer: you can absolutely use+} the [-participant also seems-] {+word Information if you want.

Participant: It’s just what’s happening.

Interviewer: If you want+} to use
[-data-as-technical, because they describe punching in-] {+Data and Information as synonymous,
you can.


Participant: I’ll try not to, I’ll try to use some sort of hierarchy of those
words.

Interviewer: If you don’t consider it to be+} a [-few numbers-] {+hierarchy...

Participant: I do consider it+} to [-get-] {+be a hierarchy, but it’s not very clear in
my mind.

Interviewer: so they’re sending you daily occurrences in+} a [-drawing as-] data [-as well.

This interview represents-] {+flow.

Participant: Lots of data, which I’m handling to try to understand
what’s going on. As+} a [-fascinating departure from-] {+position 100, in this particular thing, position
100 was an euphemism for what I was being asked to do. And what I
was really being asked to do was to be+} the [-normal affordances
expressed-] {+leader of the group. Without
offending the position 101.

Interviewer: Would you say that your role as group leader was different
from your role+} as {+position 100, or was+} it [-provides-] {+just+} a [-strong definition of data and knowledge and-] {+polite label?
Participant: It was+} a [-very weak, subsidiary, and technical view of information. One possible explanation is that, coming from

another country’s cultural understandings, participant linked the term information-] {+polite label. But I tried+} to
[-the computerized bits and had less experience with other uses of information. This interview, alone, suggests-] {+run+} a [-strong need for an international investigation into the different
cultural philosophies-] {+very democratic
type+} of [-data.

The participant engaged-] {+group. But I think when you work+} in [-an interesting interview: they
produced two diagrams exploring both an academic project
and an engineering project. In both frames of thought, par-

The participant is an engineer. Data are
numbers that are orderable within-] a [-list.

Source code is also considered-] {+hierarchy, people don’t
have+} to [-be data as-] {+have+} it [-is comprised of numbers and instructions

ticipant describes data as something inherently numeric,
with-] {+all that democratic. But you have to have+} some [-basis in fact.

Data, information, and knowledge relate-] {+reality
that people can say what they need to say anytime. And they can
question any decision.

Interviewer: position 100 back... So you’re assembling this. Are there
flows of stuff there, perhaps to yourself or yourself+} in [-a cyclic hierarchy. Data interpreted
via existing knowledge creates information. Information analyzed creates knowledge.

There is a container metaphor-] {+other roles?
Participant: I think+} in this [-philosophy as, “Information can appear alongside
knowledge or as a component of knowledge.” As a practical example-] {+particular case there were lots+} of [-this philosophy:
equipment returns data that is processed into information via an engineer. Analysis
is then performed as to “whether things are working.” Information is produced by an
analysis-] {+flows+} of [-data.

Knowledge is fundamentally experiential: “I would define knowledge as something
that an individual or entity... something that an entity possesses. That typically has been
learned from somewhere else or gained from experience or whatever that enables them-]
{+things, because in the group 104, in the main group 104, there was+} a [-better understanding then they would have otherwise.” Knowledge as understanding represents knowledge as model, articulating-]
{+position 106, a position 107. I’ll call him+} the [-nature of-] {+position 107. There was+}
the [-universe by making
predictions about future events.


Knowledge acts as-] {+position 101 and there was+} the [-agent that transforms data into information:
My understanding-] {+position 108. Now, we all had to
work together and my job was to lubricate all+} of [-how-] {+these+} things [-would work is-] {+to make
sure+} that [-knowledge is-] {+everything was happening correctly. There was a natural
suspicion of+} the
[-process by which data is turned into information. So-] {+position 101 with the position 107. The position 101
and+} I [-would say data
is things. It is numbers, it is raw information. It is something that,
on its own, doesn’t mean very much. It’s just stuff. Information is an
interpretation of that. So it’s kind-] {+were pretty reasonable friends. The position 108 and I were pretty
reasonable friends. And for a lot+} of [-something that is understandable-] {+the time the position 107 and I were
pretty reasonable friends. We never got+} to [-someone without knowledge, without even concept-] {+be enemies, but we got a
little bit separated. There was a bit+} of [-what-] {+tension across this way, and it was
my job to make sure that everything happened as it should happen. The
position 101 couldn’t do+} the [-raw
data is.


Knowledge is understanding: advice about-] {+noun 109. And+} the [-causes of unexpected events. Knowledge can-] {+position 107, wanted to+}
be [-communicated-] {+acknowledged for being a position 107+} and {+didn’t necessarily want
to get ... he wanted to be a bit more of+} the [-creation-] {+– not necessarily to delve
into the depths+} of [-understanding-] {+the detail. A bit more+} of {+an adviser. And+} the [-process under
investigation-] {+position
108 just wanted to get on with it. Which+} is [-knowledge. Documentation contains knowledge because-] {+exactly the right sort of
person to have. And+} it [-presents-] {+was my job to work on each of those issues.

As I mentioned to you, this issue of noun 110 in this noun 111 was+} a
[-history-]
{+tremendously important part+} of [-actions,-] {+this endeavor, so I’ll talk about that a
bit more. Things like knowing the hardware+} and [-can provide methods for analyzing data. The analyzed data, in
some ways-] {+so fort that+} the [-“understood data,” is collected in things like reports. The report, however,
just contains facts about-] {+group
wants, we dealt with it. We worked out+} what [-was done and the results. “[Less meaningful] stuff is the
information-] {+we wanted+} and the [-results are data.”
Data are numbers: “You can put them in a list. There is a defined quantity. They
can be grouped, they can be ordered or whatever. They probably are data. You can put
them in a spreadsheet.” However, the emphasis seems to be on numbers rather than on
scientific results: not on the objectivity but on the coding mechanism. The participant
believes that code is data: source code is instructions and numbers-] {+group
105 gave it+} to [-work with.

Information is connected-] {+us, etc.. But+} with [-the communicative act. Facts are transmitted via
information, but there does not seem to be any evidence-] {+this – with respect+} to [-indicate that facts are information, merely-] {+noun 110. ... The
noun 111 had various shapes+} that [-information is the semiotic encoding [59] process-] {+you could observe+} by [-which they are
communicated. Knowledge can be communicated through information. The recipient,
in possession of this encoded knowledge, must then analyze-] {+eye .... And+} the [-information to retrieve
its knowledge component.

In some ways, information described-]
{+noun 110 thing became a classification thing. Now,+} in [-this philosophy echoes-] the [-information as
container philosophy of Interview VIII. While there is evidence-] {+early days+} of
{+this,+} the [-participant’s cyclic

hierarchy, there are interesting ambiguities relating-] {+best we could get+} to {+was about 65

...

Interviewer: Your conjectures... So we’ve got position 100?
Participant: So therefore I became+} the [-relationship of information,
“raw information”, and facts. While data are encoded pre-facts expressed as numbers,
this interview presents difficulties in classification and represents an edge case worthy-] {+position 113+} of [-future research.


7.5.3.6 Interview X
This interview also involved someone external-] {+that meeting,
which everybody allowed me+} to [-BlueScope
Steel. Their philosophy of data represents something with-] {+be.

Interviewer: Is position 113 a better term for modeling that meeting
than position 100?
Participant: Probably. But I was+} a [-strong sense of embodiment; data is physically present in

Interviewer: So there’s you as position 113,+} and [-can be discovered through measurement.

Data represents-] {+there’s you as participant. What role were you playing as participant?
Participant: I was+} the [-fundamental relationship of things-] {+position 114 ...

Interviewer: So we’ll go with position 114?
Participant: Sure.

Interviewer: Because there’s time when you could be sending stuff+} to [-one another.-]
the [-world, in relations between matter. Measurements-] {+position 113.

Participant: Yes, I could be. The position 113 always listened to me.

Interviewer: What other roles did we have at that meeting?
Participant: The position 101,+} and
[-observations can discover data, but not create it out of subjective whole cloth.

One of-] the [-more interesting concepts of-] {+position 108, and+} the [-interview was that of formality.-] {+position
107. That’s who they were. You’re asking me what their roles were?+}
The
[-idea of formality is raising-] {+position 107 was mainly+} a [-McLuhan-like “medium is the message” level-] {+position 115+} of [-meta-analysis.

It notes that-] the [-context of-] {+current verb 112
technology. The position 101 was very passive. So it was+} a [-communication and its source within an organization
contribute significantly to the actions one takes upon it, despite the same communication
being passed from different directions: “Information passed from knowledge won’t
be turned into knowledge by the recipient due-] {+passive role,
but I don’t know if I could put another word to it. Write down passive
until we get+} to {+another word. And the position 108 was basically+} a [-lack-]
{+supporter+} of [-formal power within-] the
[-organization. The information is just ‘the background why’-] {+idea+} that [-doesn’t change actions.”
Formality, the coding-] {+we needed to change.

Interviewer: Did any+} of {+them play multiple roles?
Participant: So I played a multiple role. Those two roles. And I think
actually our roles were changing during+} the [-“authority” encoded in-] {+day. .... And then I became+}
the [-message’s medium, is
something-] {+position 114 of+} that [-modulates knowledge rather than a unique category to itself. Formality
represents-] {+method. At the end of that meeting, I was
very much+} an [-actionable instance-] {+position 114 of that method. It’s more perhaps part+} of [-whatever-]
the [-category is. Written reports, delivered-] {+position 113 role. I had+} to [-responsible people in the organization, are an example-] {+keep this meeting to be constructive. A
few, I think can remember, a few pretty straight truths were told to
each other at various times+} of [-formal knowledge. They
are incorporated into-] the [-organization’s stock of knowledge and acted upon. Those
same reports delivered-] {+meeting, but it was in a constructive
way. The position 101 was pretty passive. He was wanting, quietly,
everything+} to [-interested parties, informally, do not have-] {+move to a new state. ... And+} the [-same actionable

qualities.

Formal knowledge is an expression and transference of technical understanding.

Components of-] {+position 108 who was
supporting it again was wanting to make sure that we got. I think
there was probably in+} the [-flow described by-] {+three people, myself+} the [-participant include distilled-] {+position 108+} and [-certified data
sets,-] the [-analysis of those sets, and other supporting observational material. The certification of-]
{+position 101, we were all probably coming into+} the [-data sets is to insure-] {+meeting thinking+}
that the [-analysis is internally consistent. Certification
is checking the fit of “internal guidelines of quality.” To designate something as certified
is-] {+position 107 needed+} to [-express an opinion-] {+move ground a little bit. There was this
element+} of [-its reliability and repeatability. Because-] {+coercion, subtly there.

Interviewer: Let’s start by looking at some+} of the [-additional
process-] {+flows+} of [-certification, formal x can be acted upon. The participant believes that normal
flows, lacking confirmation, are not processed in the same way.

There is clear evidence for a reverse hierarchy in-] the [-interview. The Tuomi hierarchy suggests that-] {+meeting.

Maybe with this coercion noun 97. What flows were there?
Participant: I think+} we [-use knowledge to build information that allows us to extract-] {+probably started in a facts and+} data
[-from-] {+way. I would,
as position 113, would have asked+} the [-world; this data then allows us-] {+position 107/position 115+} to {+just
give us an+} update [-our models of the world. In this way,
as information frames our requests-] {+on where he was getting to.


Interviewer: That request+} for [-data (subjective or objective as they may be)-] {+update, should we call+} it [-is
possible-] {+request for
update or something else?
Participant: Call for Information, I think, maybe Knowledge. If we had
Knowledge.

Interviewer: Do we want+} to [-check the integrity of the data and contextualize-] {+call+} it [-by inspecting the originating information. Experiments can be designed to extract information from sensors
and computing devices operating on machinery. When sensors are rare, experiments
are designed to maximize “reliable information from an experiment.”
Knowledge is expertise. Expertise, however, is expressed as an understanding-] {+for something? What was it a call
for?
Participant: I think in casual use+} of the [-world that shapes action. The participant observes that “corridor conversations”
discussed in an informal setting can contain information and knowledge.-] {+word, it was a call for Information.

Interviewer: Was this call for+} Information,
[-in-] {+Data, Information, Knowledge or other?
Participant: It was Information and Knowledge. that’s what I was wanting.

Interviewer: What were you sending over+} this [-case, “is-] {+call? What is+} the [-things-] {+nature
of+} that {+call?
Participant:+} I [-can reduce to something technical.” Knowledge “is their
understanding-] {+don’t know how I would put it. Could you step out+} of {+your
role for a moment and help me with what you think it might be. Do
you have this often?
Interviewer: We don’t have to identify it as Data, Information, or Knowledge. On+} the [-process, how-] {+other hand, what you’re doing here, you’re telling them
that they need to give you Information+} and [-why-] {+Knowledge.

Participant: Maybe, what+} they [-turn levers-] {+give back. I ask for Information+} and [-their perception of
the basis of that.” Thus, as expertise accumulates from-]
{+Knowledge, but I think what they will give back are three things. Data,
Information, and Knowledge. Probably all mixed in together.

Interviewer: So they give back all three.

Participant: It goes backwards to everybody.

Interviewer: What is+} the [-past shared precedents-] {+label+} of
[-actions, events,-] {+their response? What are you asking
them to give, Information+} and [-training,-] {+Knowledge about? Their model?
Participant: Yes,+} it [-acts as a guide to action. It informs information-gathering
methodologies, which then inform data-collection strategies. The use of “reduce” in-] {+was about+} the

you want+} is [-“under” knowledge.-] {+for them to give you+} Information [-has a temporal element or has a different level of reliability. Whereas
more sensors, both cheaper-] and [-more connected, produce more data, the output of
multiple sensors over time produces information. “In-] {+Knowledge about...

Participant: Exactly. Progress...

Interviewer: Now, what they give back to you, was it+} the [-context of-] {+progress update, or was it something else?

Interviewer: But, along with that, they send non-verbal cues. To+} the [-database,
you don’t know how-]
{+same daisy-chain?
Participant: You’ve modeled+} it [-was acquired.” Although information may appear to be used
synonymously with data,-] {+as a daisy-chain.

Interviewer: In the model it’ll go+} there [-is-] {+and then explode. But I need
some way of... It’s not+} a [-suggestion that-] {+daisy chain, it’s+} a {+simultaneous communication.

They send the progress update qua Data. Then they send the same nonverbal cues in the same explody.

Participant: So the verbal+} thing can [-be classified-] {+contain Data+} as [-data or
information based on-] {+well as Knowledge
and Information.

Interviewer: What aspect of the progress update contained Information?
Participant: The Information about the overall performance about the
noun 110 program.

Interviewer: So we have the progress update as Data. We have overall
performance discussion as Information. And the second one is overall
performance?
Participant: Yes. There’s+} some [-kind-] {+details, some breakdown+} of [-underlying or meta-characteristic.

For example,-] {+that. It’s not
just+} a [-physical sample can embody both data and information, depending-] {+single thing.

Interviewer: But it’s an informative flow.

Participant: Yes, it is.

Interviewer: Do they also send a Knowledge flow?
Participant: If you want+} to [-whom-] {+take+} it [-is sent. This suggests that observations-] {+up to another level, the level of: are
we achieving our goals+} and [-numbers-] {+things like that, I think it’s getting to be a
more inclusive thing. It might be heading from Knowledge towards...

Interviewer: So they+} are [-latent in the
world. In this way, observation transforms latent information or data in the atomic or
molecular structure of the thing being experimented upon into-] {+sending something about goal status maybe?
Participant: There’s something+} more [-easily recognizable
numbers with defined error limits. This transformation-] {+than Information there.

Interviewer: So the goal status+} is {+Knowledge?
Participant: Yeah, it’s a higher thing, and I think the ... I’m+} not [-an external imposition-] {+quite
sure where you put those. It might be part+} of
[-measurement, but a recognition-] {+Information. It’s getting
to be part+} of [-something that is already there.

Information is an observation-] {+a bigger picture thing. It’s bringing together a number+} of [-the world. Observations-]
{+pieces+} of [-physical nature are
information assigned from parameters informed by knowledge as previous experience.

The participant strongly believes-] {+Information.

Interviewer: This bringing together, would you say it’s Information or
Knowledge?
Participant: It’s hard to say+} in the [-objectivity of information. They require-] {+abstract.

Interviewer: Would you say+} that
[-different types-] {+it’s both?
Participant: It can be, yeah. I think part+} of [-measurements-] {+it’s Knowledge, part+} of [-the same object correspond. In-] {+it’s
Information.

Interviewer: What about nonverbal?
Participant: I think that in+} this [-instance,-] {+situation where, after+} a [-sample
represents embodied information. There is no inherent knowledge of what it is-] {+while+} in [-the
object, but it is information. If the information is analyzed, it then can become data. In-] this [-vein, environmental observations surrounding the sample are information, creating-]
{+meeting, I think although we were trying to be+} a [-“picture-] {+very happy family,
each+} of [-the problem.” Binary signals from switches can be information or data,
depending-] {+us would know if we were+} on [-whether they represent state status (information)-] {+the team of 3+} or [-measurements-] {+the team+} of

[-127

quantities and masses.

The apex-] {+1. It

would be some feeling+} of [-the hierarchy-] {+– I don’t have much support here or I do have
a bit of support here. Which+} is [-data. Data are contextualized hard numbers. Data
can be generated from “something you can reduce to-] {+probably the reason why the position
101 was+} a [-number. It has observations, but
it’s reducible-] {+bit passive. He was trying not+} to [-a number.” Optimally, samples will-] be [-accompanied by recorded site
observations, situating-] {+on one side or+} the [-sample-] {+other.

As position 113, I should have been that way too. As position 113, I was+}
in [-some sort of context.

Unlike the other interviews, this one holds no indication-] that [-contextualization
serves to transform the data into information. Instead, contextualization creates data-] {+role, but in my position 114 role, I was pushing my own...

Interviewer: In+} that [-are more valuable. All things contain within them latent information that, through
the correct experiments, may be observable. Only through analysis can-] {+case, who do you think was picking up these nonverbal cues.

Participant: I think everybody picks up+} the [-observed
and recorded results be promoted-] {+nonverbal cues. We’re very
used+} to [-data. One method of analysis is-] {+working with each other. At this stage, we’ve worked with each
other for+} a [-chemical analysis
because-] {+long time.

Interviewer: These non-verbal cues, Data, Information, Knowledge,
other?
Participant: Mostly Data, I think.

Interviewer: So+} the [-results-] {+position 115, in his progress update is spewing out
all kinds+} of [-chemical analysis are deemed “real”-] {+stuff,+} and [-“hard data” numbers
according to standards.

At-] {+you called for a progress update. You say “position
115, give me a progress update.” probably in nicer tones.

Participant: I think we all gave progress updates, he wasn’t+} the [-same time, data has different natures according to-] {+only
one.

Interviewer: Did all of you give+} the [-roles that need-] {+same coordinated... set of flows?
Participant: I think so. So+} the
[-data. “The geologist says-] {+person+} I [-want-] {+called+} the [-sample.-] {+position 115, the
position 107.+} The [-chemist says-] {+position 108 gave his update, and+} I [-want-] {+think+} the [-analysis.”
The participant notes that for other roles, data’s substance can be process data or-] {+position
101 probably talked about+} the
[-discovery-] {+things he was particularly interested in.

What he was doing was opening up a new idea. He was sort+} of [-relations within the-] {+thinking
this other idea doesn’t work, let’s try something out.

Interviewer: So they all+} set [-of process data.

Data exist at various levels of accuracy. “Industrial quality” data has accuracy
considerations different from those of academic or theoretical quality. Furthermore, dud
data-data-] {+progress updates to the position 113?
Participant: To the meeting. We’re all in the meeting.

Interviewer: So people are sending it to the meeting, not to anyone
specific. So we have position 113 to position 115 going “Call for progress”
That’s something, but we don’t know what+} that {+thing+} is [-erroneous-is possible and is-] {+yet. Do you
have any intuitions?
Participant: I don’t know. It’s not – I’m thinking it’s+} a [-likely result of cost-saving measures.


7.5.4 Interview Conclusion-] {+lower level thing,
really. It’s somewhere down – it might just be Data.

Interviewer:+} The [-original intent of the interviews was-] {+position 115+} to [-serve-] {+the meeting sent? A progress update,+}
as [-a pilot project for a much larger
series-] {+Data, nonverbal cues as Data
Participant: But he also conveyed Knowledge. And Information as well
as the Data.

Interviewer: He conveyed his overall performance as Information?
Participant: yes.

Interviewer: Or do you mean as part+} of [-analysis and diagramming studies. However,-] {+these?
Participant: It was conveyed,+} the [-remarkable results and over
100,000 words-] {+update contained all+} of [-transcript-] {+those aspects
of Data, Information, and Knowledge. But+} I [-managed from-] {+don’t mind if you show
them by separate flows.


Interviewer: So all of+} these [-interviews provided sufficient justification-] {+flows are contained within the progress
update.

Participant: Because it’s not as well organized as computers talking+} to [-stop-]
{+each other.

Interviewer: We’ll kill+} the [-first interview process here. Each interview presented-] {+progress update as+} a [-unique

philosophy of data that, while-] {+flow because we can
decompose+} it [-may share some common traits with the-] {+as these+} other [-interviews, offered opportunities for either the construction-] {+flows. So we’ve got nonverbal cues as Data,
We’ve got overall performance as Information. And all+} of [-data or the identification-] {+these we
understand as part+} of
[-its relationships to information and knowledge in some novel way. This presentation was
sufficient to demonstrate that people indeed held-] {+the progress. As Information, we have the goal
state.

Participant: Now the goal state, now we’re drawing it this+} different [-philosophies of data and that
my methodology could evoke some aspects of-] {+way,
I think the meeting is actually concluding with this Knowledge, from+}
those [-philosophies. This analysis section
represents first reflections-] {+feeds. It is producing the Knowledge.

Interviewer: Who does the meeting send this Knowledge to?
Participant: At this stage, the Knowledge stayed within the meeting.

But we probably wrote it down at the time. We would have written it+}
on [-those interviews and a basis for further refinement of
research directions.


7.6 Surveys
To demonstrate that-] the [-results of-] {+blackboard in those days.

Interviewer: So+} the [-research were not a fluke of my methodology, I
then decided to run a set of surveys-] {+meeting produced Knowledge sent+} to [-explore another perspective-] {+the blackboard. The Knowledge produced we can label as?
Participant: What went+} on the [-philosophy of
data. This section documents-] {+blackboard would have contained these
conclusions, which are Knowledge. The blackboard also got some other
things like to-do lists.

Interviewer: Did+} the [-results of my second survey attempt and is a check on-] {+meeting produce these to-do lists?
Participant: Yes.

Interviewer: Is this to-do list, Data, Information, Knowledge, other?
Participant: It’s more or less Data, I think.

Interviewer: So, the meeting, sent to+} the {+blackboard+} conclusions [-drawn from my interviews. Many different participants participated in
this survey, being drawn from academics, IT professionals, other workers at BlueScope,-] and [-intelligence workers from-] {+a
to-do list. The position 115 sent to+} the [-United States civilian and military intelligence establishments.

Survey analysis will proceed in-] {+meeting as+} a [-roughly straightforward fashion. I will discuss
interesting aspects of each incoming survey,-] {+whole nonverbal
cues+} and [-try to derive their philosophy-] {+overall performance+} of [-data
by looking at how they classify data, information, and knowledge. Their classifications
and-] {+his algorithm. Did+} the [-relationships they articulate between them may give some clue about each
participant’s philosophies of data. Less time will be spent on each individual survey due-] {+position 115
send anything else+} to [-their less comprehensive nature. The terms “participant” and-] the [-singular “they” will
continue to be used to indicate-] {+meeting?
Participant: Later on in+} the [-survey-taker.

These surveys were-] {+meeting,+} the [-first deployment of my survey methodology that resulted-] {+position 115 was a strong
participant+} in
[-any kind of success. As such,-] the [-instructions-] {+discussion about how we+} were [-not close-] {+going+} to [-perfect, with a few survey-

takers misunderstanding-] {+improve+} the [-instructions.-]
{+noun 110.

Interviewer: Improvement discussion?
Participant: Yup.+} I [-state this-] {+think it starts+} with [-certainty as one participant
(name withheld, but permission given) had the following-] {+Data. And then you sort of start+}
to [-say in an e-mail:
Also, I had a hard time with the questions. About midway through-] {+integrate things.

Interviewer: The meeting integrates things. What does+} the
[-survey, I realized that some-] {+meeting do
with these integrated things?
Participant: Then it’s trying to make decisions. The decisions are finally
part+} of the [-questions were looking for a semantic
understanding of-] {+to-do list.

Interviewer: So improvement discussion as Data goes into+} the [-meaning of-] {+meeting,
it goes grindgrindgrind and it outputs+} the [-highlighted words. I began-] {+to-do list onto+} the
[-survey looking at it through an analyst’s eyes, with-] {+blackboard.

Does+} the [-understanding
that data coming in only becomes information or knowledge if it reveals
something about-] {+position 115 get anything from+} the [-intended target – usually-] {+meeting?

Participant: He will get items on the to-do list. He will get+} a [-person or group-] {+lot+} of [-people (network). As I went along, I realized that you were differentiating
between data, information, and knowledge as semantic definitions-]
{+nonverbal communication, etc.. about what goes on.

Interviewer: Is he getting+} that
[-all described different types of incoming “media” or “communications”.

I got-] {+from+} the [-impression that you viewed data as something measurable,
information as something that feeds understanding, and knowledge as
something that is either factual-] {+meeting, the position 114,+} or [-knowable. Since these-]
{+the supporter?
Participant: These+} are [-pretty
disparate understandings of-] {+very hard to separate. I think+} the [-terminology,-] {+way that we
were trying to run it,+} it was [-difficult-] {+from the meeting. The collective.

Interviewer: So the meeting was sending back+} to [-reconcile my answers between-] the [-two methods of differentiating-] {+position 115 nonverbal cues?
Participant: Yeah.

Interviewer: These nonverbal cues
Participant: Data
Interviewer: Would you say that+} the [-data
types.

I offer this as perhaps an anecdotal story about-] {+meeting changed+} the [-problems with
this kind of question. Like so many issues surrounding understanding within a community (e.g., religious doctrine),-] {+position
115’s mind?
Participant: Yes, because at+} the [-real question
here is perhaps not so much a matter-] {+end+} of [-different perceptions within
a subculture, but whether or not-] the [-subculture has taken-] {+meeting he agreed that we
would change+} the [-time-] {+approach.

Interviewer: Did the meeting send anything+} to
[-clearly define their terminology-] {+him+} to [-enable effective communication.

For more “tangible” elements of conversation, like computer design,
engineering,-] {+change his mind+}
or [-medicine, the subcultures tend-] {+did someone else send something+} to [-build a sophisticated
lexicon of industry jargon very quickly, because-] {+him?
Participant: I think that at this particular occasion,+} the [-objects described
(whether processes, methods, tools, concepts,-] {+reason I said
I was the position 114, once+} or [-physical things) are
easy to understand. With subcultures that focus on more ambiguous
topics (freedom, truth, spirituality, goodness, guilt, culpability),-] {+twice in a lifetime you get moment of
clarity. And what we were talking about then was what was called+} the
[-clarity-]
{+learning set. So+} of [-their jargon becomes diluted by variation-] {+these X noun 116s or Y noun 116s, however many
there were, what had been done+} in [-understanding
of-] the [-meanings-] {+past was that the expert, our
position 101, would say that this set+} of {+squiggles is 1a and this set is
3c. And+} the [-subculture’s terminology. You (purposely?) do-] {+squiggles were something that, ... we’re+} not [-define-] {+necessarily
particularly perfect. But then, around that time, we had just got our
automatic data logging stuff. And we could see+} what [-information, data, and knowledge mean in your survey.

Therefore,-] these [-terms will carry-] {+squiggles
looked like on+} a [-wide variety of denotations and connotations with them. The implication is-] {+screen spread out. And so, as we started to talk through
these things, I think+} that [-effective communication
within-] the [-intelligence subculture cannot begin until-] {+position I put to everybody was: if+} the [-subculture’s
definition of these terms is made explicit.


Therefore,-]
{+learning set isn’t perfect, how can we expect+} the [-products of this analysis should be taken with a grain of salt, and
used-] {+recognizer+} to [-suggest-] {+get it
right? The basic thing+} that [-far more work can be done in this area, as opposed to presenting
any kind of definitive or reproducible look at-] {+was said was: let’s use our new equipment ...,
and we will get things that we believe are absolutely perfect examples
for+} the [-philosophy-] {+full period+} of [-data.


As stated in the methodology *,-] the [-surveys allowed participants to self-identify

See page 69.


by role-] {+window+} and [-then classify a series of scenarios * as to being data, information, knowledge,
or other. The self-identification of role will be communicated in summarized form in
each survey below. The summary-] {+they+} will be [-generalized to preserve confidentiality. From
each survey, I will abstract the most interesting explanations given-] {+our new learning set.

There was no loss+} of [-categorization.

Included-] {+face+} in [-each summary will also be a description-] {+terms+} of the [-general proportions of-] {+methodology,+} the
[-answers. Each participant not only has their own philosophy of data, but their own
rationale-] {+learning set
was improved because we now were able to see it+} for [-identifying things as Data, Information, Knowledge, or Other. The analysis
will also briefly touch on the nature of each participant’s categorizations of the Other,
and how they may influence their philosophy of data.

Each introductory paragraph will contain a count, as noted, of X data, Y information, and Z knowledge. Although-] {+what+} it [-is possible-] {+was really
with our new equipment. I think+} that [-interesting statistical observations
may be made from-] {+really was+} the [-relative proportions of classification,-] {+difference between+}
the [-main items-] {+position 107 and those+} of [-interest
in my research-] {+us who+} were {+working a little bit more in+}
the [-participants’ explanations of their decisions, rather than the
quantization of the decisions themselves. In addition,-] {+field. Was that+} the [-number-] {+position 107 was thinking+} of [-surveys is not sufficiently high for any statistically useful generalizations. As ever,-] this [-research is just
laying the foundation for-] {+as much+} more [-intensive research,-]
{+abstract way,+} and [-I feel that-] {+we were saying, hey,+} this [-survey structure
could form the basis for an excellent long-term study of many people’s philosophies of
data and how they change over time.


7.6.1 Survey I
The participant-] is [-working in-] {+... And so that was really+}
the [-database labs of a university. They classified most scenarios as information-] {+difference+} and [-knowledge, with the counts-] {+we said that probably within a couple+} of [-the various classifications being:
3 Data, 11 Information, 10 Knowledge,-] {+days we
had assembled a new learning set+} and [-2 Other. Participant was careful to classify
*

See Appendix A.


other scenarios-] {+we had gone from 65
Interviewer: You+} as {+position 114 had+} a [-“lack-] {+moment+} of [-data” and “ambiguous”-] {+clarity+} that [-increases-] {+you
transmitted to+} the [-reliability-] {+meeting.

Participant: Yes.

Interviewer: This moment+} of [-prior
categorizations-] {+clarity, Data, Information, Knowledge?

Participant: It came out+} as [-it demonstrates that participant is not afraid-] {+Data.

Interviewer: So you communicated this moment+} of [-novel categorization.

•
•
•

Data is-] {+clarity as Data.

Participant: It’s one of those things that people who are+} a [-symbol without meaning. Some quotes:
“This doesn’t necessarily contain information and-] {+little more
extroverted tend to speak before they think. So the stuff that comes
out+} can be [-simply random.”
“A design may or may not convey information.”
“[secret] Code, in this case, is data since it does not have information. However, if it
is decrypted, it becomes information.”
The participant presents a novel interpretation of data. One explanation of the

unusual sense of symbol without meaning is that-] {+pretty rusty. And I think+} the [-participant’s role is sharply different when compared-] {+meeting was able+} to [-the other interviews. Furthermore, when considered in light
of databases,-] {+build on
that. I clarified my own position, etc..

Interviewer: Let’s look at that. You as position 114 sent+} a [-purely technical understanding-] {+moment+} of [-data could support the symbol-without-meaning interpretation if the participant does not assign computers-]
{+clarity into+} the [-ability to
manipulate meaning.

•
•
•

Information is classified-] {+meeting+} as [-“anything with meaning”:
“Information, since data doesn’t necessarily have-] {+Data. Who built on that?
Participant: I think I got+} a [-meaning and knowledge is factual/practical information. A letter, therefore, can be knowledge, but is normally
just information.”
“’Locations-] {+little bit+} of [-parts’-] {+encouragement, in the first instance, I built on that.

Interviewer: Where does that flow come from?
Participant: I+} would [-[be] basic information.-] {+imagine that what happened was, that when that
idea was first put up, people said oh yeah, there might be something
in that. Then we said, the position 108: how could we do this?+} The [-data has meaning, however-]
{+idea was accepted almost immediately as being reasonable and then
we wanted to know whether+} it
[-does not detail practical or factual steps of information.”
“The data is known-] {+was feasible+} to [-be a planning program, so-] {+do it. And when+} it [-has meaning.”
The notation of meaning in information has links with the information-as-commu-

nication theme found in some interviews above, but suggests-] {+was
proved to be feasible, people agreed that we should have+} a [-purely semiotic boundary:
symbols-with-meaning versus symbols-without-meaning, without any kind of communicative subtext.

Knowledge is classified as practical information. Some quotes:

•
•
•

“This is something-] {+go at that.

Interviewer: Then you would say+} that [-contains factual/practical information; i.e., knowledge.”
“Toughie;-] the [-story pertains to steps detailing-] {+position 108, who was the
supporter, sent+} a [-story, therefore it has chronological
sequence (i.e. - steps, procedure), so it is knowledge.”
“Step-based, procedural information is knowledge.”-] {+flow into the meeting of “let’s discuss feasibility.”+} This
{+flow, Data,Information,K?
Participant: It’s probably just Data, I think.

Interviewer: Then, people went yeah, let’s talk about feasibility. The
passive+} position [-is-] {+101 sitting there doing...

Participant: At this point, although he had+} an [-interesting one to take, inasmuch as knowledge is-] {+alternative thing up his
sleeve, he would have then supported this idea because it was+} a [-subset of

information-] {+new
thing to try and after we talked about the feasibility we didn’t think it
would be+} that [-relates-] {+hard+} to [-action or time. Knowledge is anything with practical meaning,
or in-] {+try it.

Interviewer: So the position 101’s support of idea, Data, Information,
Knowledge?
Participant: Probably just data.

Interviewer: What+} other [-words, anything-] {+interactions did people have in the meeting?
Participant: I think+} that {+this+} is [-actionable.

The participant belongs-] {+where, later+} in the [-data-as-communications camp, assigning computers-] {+meeting, where+} the [-role of data processors while granting a privileged human-centric view-]
{+to-do list starts to come out. After the moment+} of [-information-] {+clarity+} and [-knowledge as symbols with meaning (and utility). Although the relationships
between data, information,-] {+getting it
clearer+} and [-knowledge are unusual, they do not present any unexpected new philosophies.


7.6.2 Survey II
The participant works for a defense department as an information processor. They
present a strong bias towards classifying scenarios as data, with 11 as Data, 6 as Information, and 9 as Knowledge. They did not take advantage of-] {+clearer, writing up on+} the [-Other category. One
hypothesis is that as an information processor they have a very strictly operationalized
definition of information. Still,-] {+board what things look like
Interviewer: your conclusions?
Participant: yeah, I think.... That’s right. I think we concluded from+}
the [-lack of any categorization of Other suggests that-] Data
[-or Knowledge-] {+gathering stage that we+} were [-used as catchalls.

Data is an unanalyzed sign, set-] {+in trouble, we needed to do
something. And then, that’s the stage... what can we do? I had my
moment+} of [-signs, or communication. Some quotes:

•
•
•

“No analysis or recommendations for action are involved, leaving this as simply data.”
“The code has not been sorted, so-] {+clarity, I threw that into the meeting, we talked about+} it [-is still data. The fact-] {+a
lot. I think+} that the [-data is encrypted
offers some insight for analysis, so-] {+position 107 wasn’t sure about it at all. And he was
actually pretty concerned+} that [-may-] {+it wouldn’t+} be [-used to create information from this
situation.”
“Lacking detail about what-] {+right. Because in all+} the [-letter contains, I would default to-]
{+books that he read, you get+} the [-lowest category
of analysis,-] {+expert to classify,+} and [-assume it-] {+we were saying
the expert isn’t good enough+} to [-be data for-] {+classify even though he invented this.


Fortunately,+} the [-time being. I can be sure-] {+expert agreed himself+} that [-it is data,
but cannot determine from the description given-] {+maybe that was true. We
said “we can classify better+} if {+we can see+} it [-is information.”
While “data as-] {+clearer.”
Interviewer: Did you just persuade him with nonverbal cues? Or?
Participant: I think that there was+} a [-fundamental building block of information” is unambiguous,-] {+very logical argument. So that,
we’re talking about all+} the

[-attached semiotic definition results-] {+people+} in [-an uncertain hypothesis. The interesting phrase,
“Lowest category of analysis,” suggests-] {+the room scientific techo types
that you’re familiar with. People respond to+} a [-strict and articulated set of relationships among
data, information, and knowledge. The very strictness-] {+logical argument. I don’t
want to estimate non-verbal, because most+} of {+us techos most often
think nonverbal doesn’t even exist. I think, at+} the [-hierarchy, of course, means-] {+time, I certainly
would have said+} that [-accessing it is quite difficult: much of-] {+logical argument prevailed.

Interviewer: Who put+} the [-participant’s knowledge about data is tacit
and assumed, making it difficult-] {+logical argument+} to [-extract from their explanations of reasoning.

•
•
•

Information is analyzed data:
“The data-] {+whom?
Participant: I think that what happened, it’s interesting now that we’ve
written it on here. Once I had this moment+} of [-how the user interface worked is changed to information by the analysis-] {+clarity, one+} of [-the users, categorizing things into ‘good,’ ‘bad,’ ‘useful,’ etc. However, this does not
include recommendations for action, and so doesn’t quite go as far as knowledge.”
“Quotes are chosen to reflect-] {+only+} a [-given point,-]
{+few in my lifetime, I was advocating that, because I could see it really
clearly,+} and {+it was only a few minutes afterwards that I saw it as an
axiom, that it was+} so [-are offered with inherent analysis,
by the questioner, the respondent, or both. ”
“Poetry, while perhaps not designed as traditional analysis, does offer insight, and
information-at least about the poet. The poet has analyzed words, scansion, rhythm,
etc., changing raw data (perhaps Dadaist poetry?) into traditional poetry.”
Analysis of data creates information. However, if-] {+clear that+} we [-explore the meaning beyond

analyzed data, defining-] {+needed to try this. Then+} the [-term becomes quite tricky. It is easy-] {+position
108/supporter, he was jumping on board. And he was saying “Yeah, I
think it’s a good idea and I know how+} to [-exclude knowledge-] {+help to do this. Here’s this.” The
position 107 wasn’t sure because I don’t think he was really defending
something+} as [-actionable information, but the very specificity of-] {+much as saying: “I’m not sure, I’m not sure.” But I think
probably+} the [-term “analyzed data” precludes
most understanding. In some ways,-] {+logical argument was: we actually have+} the [-meaning of information could-] {+tools to do
this now, we’re not going to+} be {+waiting months to try it, we’re can try it
tomorrow, and who knows? And that would have been the persuading
things.

Interviewer: and you+} as [-broad as
information as statements about nouns in-] {+position 114 persuaded+} the [-world.


Knowledge is information applied to decision making. In many ways, this classification echoes-] {+position 115?
Participant:+} the [-knowledge of Survey I. Some choice quotes:
•
•
•

“Bob has used information (prior experience-] {+meeting persuaded. I think that as I mentioned early
on, I actually had pretty good relationships+} with [-traffic noise) to make-] {+all of these people 1:1.

But there was not such+} a [-decision
on how to behave, transforming his experience into knowledge-knowledge that he
uses to judge what sounds-] {+good relationship here or here, and so maybe
I was helping everything+} to [-ignore.”
“Charlotte has not only analyzed information-] {+come+} on [-behavior (making-] {+board because of the personal
relationship side of it.

Interviewer: So we’ve got logical argument: Data, Information, Knowledge? What is this logical argument thing?
Participant: I don’t know how we’d classify theoretical...+} it [-information),
but has taken that a step farther, into knowledge, based on its applicability.”
“Dave-] is [-providing not only analyzed data (information),-] {+one of
those things that you might receive Data,+} but [-is doing so-] {+the Data are all naturally
clicking+} to [-empower
action (a change-] {+gear+} in [-answers for-] the [-next time Eve encounters-] {+receiver’s mind.

Interviewer: Let’s look at that. You say that you receive Data, and that+}

Interviewer: We would say that this logical argument as+} a [-reasonable derivation-] {+collection+} of [-Ackoff’s hierarchy,
put to different ends. While Ackoff’s hierarchy generally has knowledge-as-model, another understanding-]
{+ordered, structured, Data is Information?
Participant: Yes, I think so. I think that’s where that changed. Because,

view necessitates filtered information,-] {+clarity, it was probably better that I threw this into the

meeting+} as [-information contains elements both-] {+Data. And then we all started clunking, clunking, clunking+}

the elements of pure-theory without application to information until they are filtered
and contextualized by use.


7.6.3 Survey III
The participant is a manager of a consumer electronics repair workshop. They gave a
normal sorting of responses, with 7 Data, 11 Information, 6 Knowledge and 2 Other. The
others were identified-] {+it, which meant that this wasn’t seen+} as [-structure:
•

“If-] {+me – my thing, because
we all worked on it. But, as I say,+} it [-is a program only with no facts or data, perhaps-] {+didn’t take me very long, where+}
this [-is just something that
transforms data into information.”

•

“I think the empty document is something that assists in organizing data into information, but-] in [-itself is just a structure.”

The wording on these strongly suggests a standard hierarchy. Furthermore, the
relationships allow transformation: data becomes information becomes knowledge.

The participant’s definition of data is slightly more problematic. Although data
can nominally-] {+my own mind had gone from an idea to being an axiom. Which,
fortunately, proved to+} be [-defined-] {+true.

Interviewer: so we’ve got this logical argument from the meeting+} as [-a statement without structure, there is little evidence-]
{+Information+} to
[-indicate what data is-] {+the position 115. But you also mentioned that you had+}
a [-statement of:
•
•
•
•

“I’d-] {+personal relationship between position 114 and position 115.

Participant: and that was just in terms of, mainly an out of work hobby.

So I had quite a good relationship with him.

Interviewer: This personal relationship. Would you+} say [-this is data, as-] {+that+} the [-facts have no relevance-] {+drawing+} on [-their own.-] {+this background, basically going: “I’m going to persuade you,
because you know that+} I’m not [-entirely clear

on+} or [-information, though.”
“This one is interesting, also. I’d see each individual mp3 file-] {+communicating Data, Information, or Knowledge?
Participant: It’s certainly got an organization to Data, at least. Whether
it goes further than that, I don’t know how these things are classified.

I’m a bit unsure about how to deal with that. It’s beyond data.

Interviewer: Is it Information?
Participant: I think he would have used it+} as [-information, but-] {+Information.

Interviewer: He perceived+} the [-group of them together as data,-] {+flow+} as {+Information. Because, he saw+} it [-feels like more of a random sample than a

“The randomness and lack-]
{+as “here’s this guy, I trust this guy because+} of [-interpretation leads me-] {+our shared hobby. He’s

would see that as Information.

Participant: I don’t+} think {+that, for+} this [-is data.”
“The quotes themselves are data until they are processed, at which time-] {+meeting,+} that would
[-become information.”
The first quote suggests data are facts, but does not indicate the participant’s

understanding of fact. The second quote belies the traditional hierarchy by placing-] {+have been+}
a [-set
of data above information, though the trend of randomness or “lack of structure equals

Information is analyzed data:

“I’d say this is knowledge, as she has taken-] {+to+} the [-information and used-] {+meeting...

And the Knowledge was, status quo?
Participant: I think+} it [-to form an

•

“Someone’s impressions-] {+state+} of [-something would be the conclusions they’ve drawn from-] the [-information, so I’d say knowledge.”

•

“That selection is a conclusion based on understanding-] {+art+} of [-what he is doing.”
From-] these [-quotes, the participant suggests-] {+techniques
and+} that [-analysis-] {+sort+} of [-information becomes

knowledge. Knowledge as understanding or conclusions does not suggest-] {+thing. I think similarly+} the [-use to

Participant is a social entrepreneur. Their self-description of their role emphasized
management and planning skills with a correspondingly high information consumption.

something higher above Information.

Interviewer: So Information becomes Knowledge?

Interviewer: Do any of+} these [-problems there seems to be some

Data is an observation:
“Random noise can be data.”
“Data only-no context or filters to apply.”
“Encrypted information is structured data without a context for Alice to extract
relevant knowledge from.”
Data is filtered and structured by knowledge, thereby producing information. The

Information is comprised of filtered, structured,-] {+ways. You can send Knowledge back as Data+}

Interviewer: So Data can become Information. How does Data become
Information?
Participant: I think Data becomes Information by+} a [-component of-] {+person or machine
collecting+} the [-analysis

performed upon data to create information.


Knowledge has explanatory force. It entails conclusions-] {+Data+} and [-explanations-] {+drawing something out+} of [-the

Participant: Yes. I think you can do both.

Interviewer: So+} Data [-are observations of-] {+can precipitate Information or Knowledge.

Participant: I don’t know to get Knowledge it has to go through+} the [-world:
“At this-]
{+Information+} stage [-the numbers and times are data. Study and interpretation of these will
lead to information-] or [-knowledge about the thing that is unknown.”
“The noise is a meaningless stream-] {+not. I’m+} not [-constructed into anything more significant.”
“Just listening to a live music stream is receiving data. Gaining pleasure from the

information or indeed knowledge of-] {+something along the lines of: “I’ve got+}
a [-larger portion-] {+Newton’s first law+} of [-music, e.g.-] {+motion or something in my mind, and I see+} the [-symphony.”

There is no evidence for any required activity with respect-]

Participant: I think they’re Knowledge.

Interviewer: They’re Knowledge because you can use them to...

Interviewer: So you can predict the future from Data... So you’ve got

Information is contextualized data:

“At-] {+I can say “hey, that’s
going to happen.”

Participant: I think It+} might be [-considered to be knowledge in itself.

However, it is information at-] {+Information. Because+} the [-level before-] {+Knowledge

In this instance, the differentiation between data and information is context. The

Data are factual records that cannot contain subjective elements such as impres-

sions or thoughts. Entertainment, as stated before, does not produce data, but the record
of someone consuming entertainment is data,-] {+Knowledge,+}
because [-it is an objective fact about their
person. Furthermore, all facts must be about activity of some sort. The participant is not
interested in scientific facts per se, but in records of actions that can be contextualized
into information and analyzed into knowledge about-] the [-target.

Information is data with context and assessment:

“As stated before,-] {+way you ask+} the [-context provides so much about m.o., etc., that-] {+question, as far as: "I have+} this [-is more
than mere data, but because there are critical parts missing or not understood,-] {+Data, I think+}
this is [-only information.”
“This is raw data regarding what was watched-] {+happening (Knowledge), But, my explanation doesn’t explain this,
this,+} and [-when. There is no assessment of
the data nor is there a greater purpose that is being described. There is no wisdom,

“There is no historical context as to why this methodology was chosen, so this is not
‘wisdom,’-] {+what do you think"

The participant-] {+your experience?" ... What should happen+} is [-a housekeeper. In this job,-] {+that+} they [-have a low exposure to workplaceenforced understandings of data. The participant has a very unusual categorization: 7
Data, 5 Information, 4-] {+do
some analysis on that data, informed hopefully by our+} Knowledge, and [-10 Other. The high rate of Other represents a
lack of broad categories. In a sense, this represents a lack of formalization from learned

The participant makes a brief mention of data as technical-communication. In
other words,-]
they [-consider data-as-bits a-] {+return to us their analysis and explanation.

Interviewer: Do we want to have+} separate [-use-] {+flows for these?
Participant: Might as well.

Interviewer: Analysis, explanation. Analysis is?

Participant: It’s probably more+} on [-computer hardware.”
In this, they also conflate-] the [-term with information, which-] {+Information. Well, it’s Data and
Information. And the explanation+} is {+Knowledge, it had better be.

Interviewer: When you say that, what do you mean?
Participant: You hope that when someone gives you their explanation,
you know more than before they told you. Not always true. They can
tell you stuff, and you can go "Well I understand even less than when I
started." Because if it’s completely contradictory to your understanding, you are now really confused. ...

Interviewer: Let’s explore that for+} a [-common usage.


However, this separate meaning should not be confused-] {+second. When their explanation

Participant: So+} the [-time. While one’s emotional response to winter wind
may be important, and interesting information, poetry about it is in-] {+database contains+} a [-different class

Information appears to be a fundamental component-] of [-data and knowledge, serv-

ing as-] a [-general communicative vehicle. It also has some elements of meta-data, as
the presence or absence of the document is termed “Information.” More research-] {+relational database+} is
[-required-] to [-see how significantly different professions interact with data, information,

Knowledge-] {+model the real world. noun 64+} is [-formalized, reliable instructions for activity:

seem certain enough for me to call knowledge.”
“Lectures about-]
{+position 58ing+} database [-design... or other academic lectures are to confer built-up
knowledge from one person to others. It’s also information.”
Knowledge is transferable, certain, and constructed. The phrase “built-up knowl-

edge” suggests a subjective, constructivist view of knowledge. Knowledge is viewed as-] {+so it’s+} a

Data are objective, precise facts:

Participant: Um, Meta-data is... I’m saying SQL is meta-data. It’s because I’m interacting directly+} with [-knowledge and data.


Although there-] {+a model of the system as opposed to

which+} is [-no discussion of-] {+Information. Then+} what [-actually comprises
information. From inference, information-] {+happens?
Participant: Let’s condense everything that goes on around that into
"the noun 75 position 100 runs a noun 75" which+} is [-contextualized-] {+– actually collects
the+} data.

[-Knowledge is explanation, chief of a hierarchy-]
{+Interviewer: The noun 75 position 100 noun 97 returns what?

•

“Depends-] {+– they’re going to return Data and Knowledge.

•

“As it stands,-] {+ask,+} then [-information, if giving reason for her-] {+they return that too. Depending
on what we find, we have+} to [-take her stuff back then

Knowledge provides reason and explanation. Only new knowledge is classified as

knowledge,-] {+go+} and [-information seems-] {+return it+} to {+a person who didn’t ask,

“The music itself is just data (unless it contains textual messages, which could be

Knowledge is a judgment:
“Bob has had to make-] {+was asked. It

7.6.15 Survey XV
The participant identifies as a SIGINT [signals intelligence] analyst-] {+request
has come+} and [-a subject-matter
expert in that field. They identify 6 Data, 1 Information, 6 Knowledge and 2 Other. The
others identified are: having an experience and art.

Participant draws a strong distinction between practical matters and art:

•
•

•

•
•

“To me, art is something different than data, information or knowledge. Art can’t be
easily classified as data or information, for instance. ”
“The music is live, and not electronically stored as information. As such, the music
is ’other’ in-] {+it’s important, decided somehow that it’s important.

Interviewer: So+} this [-case. It isn’t data, it isn’t information, and it surely isn’t knowledge
either.”
Data is a small, measurable, description of the world:
“The word ‘quizzes’ does not reveal anything particularly novel about Dave or his situation. Dave grades work from-] {+has already been+} a [-relational algebra course,-] {+validated request.

Participant: so we’ve already decided it’s been important
Interviewer:+} which {+probably means we need someone to do validation..

who does validation? And+} is [-good knowledge
about Dave and his roles and personal knowledge. Working within an educational
facility also implies something about Dave. But a quiz is not a revelatory piece of
information. It would be more revealing if Dave were grading Theses or Dissertations
or reviewing Essays or White Papers.”
“This is data because-] it [-does not reveal anything about Dave or his network-] {+at this level+} or [-his
intentions. A Word document-] {+this level?
Participant: There’s the validation+} that [-contains no information does nothing to further
analysis into Dave and his network. By-] {+self does, there’s+} the [-statement above, we already know-] {+validation+}
that
[-he is working on a conference paper.”
“The weather report is data about current weather conditions, since it-] {+team that self+} is [-a measurable
description-] {+part+} of {+does, and then there’s+} the [-weather.”
Data are-] {+validation that+}
the [-traditional building blocks-] {+wider people paying for it do.

Interviewer: Do any+} of [-information, though the quotes above

suggest that data stems from non-novel revelations. Data are measurable, small, recorded
descriptions-] {+those three levels+} of {+validation need to be differentiated from+} the [-world or target.

•
•
•

Information is an imprecise statement about the world:
“This is more than mere data, because-] {+others?
Participant: Well, if they need to be differentiated, then+} we [-know something about the sender and
recipient-] {+need to
fractal noun 75 position 100. If they don’t need to be differentiated,
then we don’t need to bother fractalling this guy.

Interviewer: is this+} of {+interest?
Participant: Probably not in this context. We’re now at+} the [-letter. It is less than knowledge, because-] {+stage where
we’re modeling how+} we [-do not yet know-] {+run noun 75s.

Interviewer: I want+} more
[-about-] {+of this level than this happens then that
happens.

Participant: There’s stuff that+} the [-sender or recipient, beyond their implicit connection to one another.”
“We know now-] {+noun 60 meets by itself. There’s stuff+}
that [-Alice is interested in building a device-] {+people have+} to [-cook her breakfast,
but-] {+go and observe. And+} we [-do not explicitly know anything about-] {+use+} the [-device itself. This means-] {+noun 71 as an example. And there’s stuff+} that we
[-do not know how feasible her breakfast-cooking endeavors are. Because of this,-] {+have to go and make happen. Those are
pretty much all+} the
[-sentence-] {+important observables about the noun 60. Important external/internal observables. which this bubble+} is [-merely information-] {+responsible
for collating+} and [-not yet knowledge.”
“We know that someone is planning something, but we do not know explicitly what
they are planning. The details-] {+trying to put into some coherent explanation+} of the [-planned activity would make-]
{+universe. And that’s why when [company] sits in+} this [-into knowledge.”

The term “more than” suggests a traditional hierarchy. However, unlike-] {+meeting, there’s
one person who’s holding+} most
[-hierarchies, information is used to identify statements that do not reveal useful patterns
due to their level-] of [-detail or other imprecision.

•

•
•

Knowledge is relationships or patterns:
“This is knowledge about the two targets within our tracked network, because it
defines loosely-] {+that, but there’s a whole bunch of
people who are peripherally involved. Like+} the [-roles that-] {+people who were involved in+} the [-two targets share between each other. Bob is-] {+original noun 95 and adjective 96 actually hold+} a
[-keeper-] {+heap

Interviewer: Conservation+} of [-the machine based on Bob’s information.

Participant: Officially it will emerge from one of two people because
they’ve got to+} be [-a connector who acts as a conduit-] {+permitted+} to [-spread information-] {+speak+} on [-machine
construction throughout-] {+behalf of+} the [-network.”
“This is knowledge because-] {+company. Officially+}
it [-implies a relationship between the two targets –-] {+will emerge from either+} the
[-sender and receiver. A short story may imply a personal relationship between-] {+position 27 or+} the
[-two targets,-] {+position 58ing position
41.

Interviewer: do they get bubbles+} or [-it-] {+a bubble?
Participant: They get separate bubbles, I’m afraid
Interviewer: We’ve got bubbles, these bubbles send a dovetailed flow
out of operating data?
Participant: They+} may [-reveal that they fulfill roles in publishing-] {+coordinate+} or [-media.”
“If we are seeking to understand Bob’s character, we now know that he enjoys symphony music. Beyond this, we can infer little from-] {+one may ask+} the [-sentence above.”
“A statistical profile-] {+other to do it or

Interviewer: That actually matters.

Participant: It really matters, yeah.

Interviewer:+} How [-many different activity types by the
target are included in the sampling?-] {+do we get that data flow out of this page?
Participant:+} How [-many external environmental variables
(associates, external events, etc.) have been considered in the analysis? Finally,-] {+do we get+} the
[-danger-] {+operating data flow out+} of [-statistical profiling is the Black Swan. Ultimately,-] this {+page?

{+those entities.

Interviewer: *1 goes+} to [-future events.

The most important aspect of this survey is that it-] {+one or both?
Participant: Yep.

Participant: Yes.

Interviewer: Incomplete Knowledge as Knowledge is flowing from+} the [-one doing-]
{+position 65 to+} the [-analysis, it would be difficult-] {+tech position 41 and position 58ing position 41 at the

Participant: Can, it’s context dependant.

a header for both?
Participant: They sit+} in [-potential participants.


7.7 Interview Analysis
Interview analysis discovered three-] different [-philosophies-] {+business units. Let’s just say, yeah.

Interviewer: One flow from position 65 to Tech or position 58ing position 25 is a flow+} of [-data. Although-] {+Knowledge of incomplete Knowledge. Are there
other flows?
Participant: If we’re physically sitting in+} the [-bubble diagrams hinted at-] {+meeting together. I can
directly tell+} the [-third philosophy, there was insufficient evidence-] {+position 59 something.

Interviewer: Do we want+} to [-brand
observations of the world with their own philosophy.

It would be hard-] {+model that?
Participant: Usually I’m doing that in response to some other query so
probably not.

Interviewer: From tech or position 58ing position 25, how do we get+} to [-deny-]
that [-interviews I and II have data as communication, III
and IV have subjective observations (with IX hinting at them) and-] {+flow?
Participant: He controls+} the [-rest considering
data as objective fact. With these broad differences evident, Question of interest 1-] {+noun 97 by which we have this conversation. So either that flow+} has been [-satisfied.

The observation philosophies differ strikingly from-] {+provided to these guys,+} the [-numeric philosophies, possibly differing on a fundamental perception of reality. As one interview-] {+incomplete Knowledge, which I’ve said, and this+} is [-trying to
render-] {+Information and Knowledge. So there’s+} the [-relationships between matter in-] {+Knowledge,+} the [-world as numbers (objectivist), another-] {+Information which+} is [-suggesting that everything emits data and we must filter it. The conflict-] {+the question
part of it+} is [-records
versus measurements versus signs. Does data measure objective reality, record subjective
reality, or merely transmit signs? Numbers are seen as-] {+either formulated by him assisted by him...

Interviewer: but it’s+} a [-result of precision most-] {+function+} of the
[-time, whereas observations are building their way towards knowledge.


7.7.1-] {+incomplete Knowledge.

...

Interviewer: Operating+} Data [-as communications
Data, in the communicative sense, merely requires signs and things to communicate with
those signs. The data can be rendered as bits or marks on paper, but it-] is [-seen as a factor
of semiotic import rather than as something to be discovered-] or [-filtered.

This philosophy-] is [-substantively different from the other two inasmuch as it does-] not [-uphold data to be an aspect of reality. Instead, data is produced as-] a [-function of
human intent. Because this philosophy does not concern itself with interactions-] {+component+} of [-the
real, there-] {+Incomplete
Knowledge?
Participant: It+} is a [-far greater difference between-] {+component.

Interviewer: where does operating data emerge from+} this [-and-] {+fractal zoom?
Participant: So+} the [-other two than between-] {+operating data –+} the

subjective-objective philosophies. However,-] {+connection to here. Because if
those guys could write a query, they’d do it themselves, but they can’t.

Interviewer: This is operating data qua data. Now,+} the [-passivity-] {+Data + Information+} of [-this philosophy allows it
to accept facts produced-] {+the analysis+} from [-either source as something to be encoded, stored, and
transmitted. Significant research needs to be done-] {+the position 59 hits whom?
Participant: It hits the position 58ing position 41/Tech position 41
Interviewer: then what happens?
Participant: Sometimes they sit on it. No. It’s discussed, circulated,+} to [-explore how this philosophy-]
{+interested parties. To which position 65 is one.


Interviewer: For purposes+} of
[-data relates to the-] {+this discussion, are there+} other [-two.

The interviews successfully explored peoples’ philosophies of-] {+interested
parties?
Participant: No.

Interviewer: *1 is what?
Participant: This stuff coming back is their analysis which is+} data and [-I consider
the interviews, in conjunction with-]
{+Information.

Interviewer: so+} the [-bubble diagrams, to completely answer Question
of Interest 1: yes, people-] {+tech position 41 is merely routing.. ?
Participant: He will also+} have [-different philosophies of data. My interviews generated
results that I was not expecting (mainly-] {+his own interpretation
Interviewer: So therefore there’s a...

Participant: a transformation could occur
Interviewer: Therefore this new Data & Information flow ... Is this new
flow Data, Information, Knowledge, or other?
Participant: We’d love it to be Knowledge, often it’s purely Data or
Information. If we hit+} the [-container metaphors), which suggests that-] {+jackpot, we get Knowledge. Let’s pretend we
hit+} the [-interpretation and differences-] {+jackpot.

Interviewer: How+} are {+we labeling this flow?
Participant: Let’s say it’s Knowledge. Let’s+} not [-merely an artifact of my analysis.

However, as I conducted the interviews and analyzed them,-] {+model reality, it’s too
hard. That provides stuff back to you. It may be+} the [-possibility exists
that I have infected-] {+answer to+} the [-analysis with my own philosophy of data, seeing in all three
philosophies aspects of my own. One area of methodological research would-]
{+question you asked, it could+} be {+the answer+} to [-design-] a [-methodology and subsequent analysis protocol-] {+different question. That
was subtly related...+} that [-can be conducted by other people,
and then to perform a much larger-scale experiment to try to reproduce these results. My
sole-] {+people misunderstanding, yeah it’s been doing
it for years. Let’s+} hope [-here was-] {+it’s Knowledge. We want it+} to [-tell a persuasive story, rather than-] {+be Knowledge.

Interviewer: is it Knowledge, or just nonsense?
Participant: the purpose of us asking is+} to [-create-] {+get Knowledge.

Interviewer: So this analysis turns into Knowledge? or is the explanation...

Participant: If they did+} a {+good enough job the explanation is Knowledge
which we can incorporate into our+} model [-for predictions-] of the [-world.


7.7.2 Data-] {+universe directly.

Interviewer: So you would directly get explanation+} as [-subjective observations

Participant: We have done. It+} can [-be captured by us. Thus, to perform sensemaking activities, we must filter and contextualize the interesting data so-] {+happen.

Interviewer: Is there translation+} that [-it can

Like-] the [-ancient Aristotelian idea of species (particles of sensation). Light-] {+tech or position 58 position
41 performs?
Participant: He can do. It depends on what he+} was [-the medium-] {+given.

Interviewer: How can we model this?
Participant: With difficulty.

Interviewer: Really what it means is+} that [-visual
species traveled within.

While this ancient philosophy-] {+these flows dovetail. Because
we’re modeling all+} of [-image is not hugely useful to us,-] the [-same intuitions that led to it could
have some parallels with data as subjective observations. This research area could make an interesting
bridge between intuitive and experimental philosophies.

Subjective data lends itself more-] {+causal fiddly bits. So,
Participant: If they’re able+} to [-cyclic hierarchies, where data begets-] {+tell me+} the [-information and knowledge used-] {+answers+} to [-collect more data, reflecting an interestingly constructivist view of knowledge. There-] {+my questions, then
you know, ???+} is [-quite a lot here available to future research,-] {+important. Stuff comes back+} and [-I do
not feel sufficiently confident-] {+we deal with it

Interviewer: At some points of time you get Knowledge explanation
back. You also directly get analysis back?
Participant: Yes.

Interviewer: Other points+} in [-my sample size to make any assertions as to relationships between data-] {+time, explanation goes through the tech
position 41 – tech position 41 gets explanation?
Participant: Explanation+} and {+analysis, it’s+} the [-various philosophies of knowledge-] {+same things.

Interviewer: Sometimes the position 58ing+} or [-science, though-] {+Tech position 41 takes+}
the
[-subjective nature of observations may tend slightly more towards Latour-] {+analysis and+} or [-Feyerabend.

Of more interest is that-] {+explanation goes "wow+} this [-inherently subjective data-] is [-constructed from the
mind’s impressions of-] {+shit" and does what
with it?
Participant: Okay, in+} the [-surroundings, rather than revealed through measurement-] {+context+} of [-the surroundings.-] {+our noun 60 what that really means
was...

Interviewer: Alright, so this is interpreted explanation? Who gets that
interpreted explanation?
Participant:+} The [-understanding of the embodiment of data-] {+position 65.

Interviewer: and that+} is [-a significant
difference between the two philosophies of data.


7.7.3-] {+Knowledge?
Participant: Yeah. It’s Knowledge... and+} Data [-as measured facts
Objective data comes with its own context “baked in.”-] {+and Information. It’s all
three again.+} It [-is, in many ways, rare:-] {+depends on what+} it [-requires
positive effort to generate, and higher quality data requires a commensurate increase in

Interviewer: So this flow+} of [-reality,-] {+Data, Information,+} and [-with enough
data, knowledge about the singular real-] {+Knowledge ... and

Participant: It’s and.

Interviewer:+} can be [-generated.

Objective data requires that data be a fact, usually a numerical, reproducible representation-] {+labeled as?
Participant: The internal? Feedback. "What feedback did you get from
those guys? Nothing!"
Interviewer: Are we missing anything?
Participant: For purpose+} of [-reality that conveys an understanding-] {+this, we’ve got conservation+} of [-measurement quality and units.

Objective data is not filtered, because it is collected-] {+Knowledge.

Interviewer: Let’s start+} with [-prior intent and all elements-] {+a discussion+} of the [-“data set” may produce interesting patterns.

Both humans-] {+diagram you’ve looked
over+} and [-sensors can reveal objective data, which is embodied-] {+that we were creating last time. We had+} in {+that diagram+} the [-things
being measured. There seems to be no significant link with-]
{+noun 71, Database, and you as noun 75 position 100. And we did not
iterate into+} any of [-the major philosophies-] {+those because+} of [-science. Although my investigations did not explore confirmation, falsifiability, or

paradigms,-] {+time constraints. Are+} there [-seems to be a common understanding that data-as-fact accurately
represents the universe within the constraints-] {+any
aspects+} of [-measurement. This may be because
the participants believed data-] {+that diagram that bear iteration?
Participant: Unless we want+} to [-be-] {+go and start modeling the actual noun
75 planning noun 97 and things, I don’t think so.

Interviewer: What I’m looking for is+} a [-building block upon which their hypotheses-] {+difference in nature+} or {+kind.

– Last interview focused on a more technical point of view. You’re
talking about interactions with databases and meta-data. Can we look
at a scenario from your experience where there’s been confusion over+}
understanding of [-the universe could be built. Understanding this particular subset-] {+data, Information, or Knowledge? In a procedural

{+philosophies.

Participant: If I’ve got+} the [-philosophy-] {+right idea, I’m thinking+} of [-data-] {+an instance where
we have some noun 60 measurements of something,+} and [-linking it-] {+they should be

– we’re trying+} to [-ramifications in the philosophy of science could

7.8 Survey Analysis
The results from the surveys successfully triangulate my results. While limited by the
same potential bias as the interview analysis,-] {+use them to understand+} the [-high variation-] {+physical conditions that
are+} in [-philosophies from-] the [-survey suggests that I may very well be on to something.

and this evolved over a couple of years+} as to [-the methods-] {+gaining consensus. And+} of [-knowing, intrinsic nature,-]
{+last week we still don’t have consensus.

Interviewer: That sounds like just the thing. Where do we start?
Participant: This is the noun 76 again. It has some noun 74points.

Interviewer: How do we want to model those?
Participant: There’s 4 points+} and [-purpose of data. In-] {+it’s+} the [-surveys, people
referred-] {+differences between those
noun 74s that we’re trying+} to [-records, observations,-] {+understand.

Interviewer: We’ll start with your interpretation,+} and [-numbers, roughly mapping-] {+then I’ll have you
try+} to [-the terms found in
the interviews.

Records, as technologically stored signs, can-] {+explain other peoples’ interpretations. With your interpretation,
what entities should there be?
Participant: There would+} be [-data if-] {+6 in total ... You don’t care what+} they [-are stored properly.

Another term for record-] {+are,
you just care that they’re there. ... The actual noun 74s that we measure
at these points+} is [-row or tuple. These tuples can be about any topic and can
suffer from anomalies: authoritative conflicts in which-] {+a function only of+} the [-database may not represent-] {+adjective 78 and+} the [-thing in-] {+adjective
79. And+} the [-universe of discourse. Despite this,-] {+adjective 79 responds+} to [-some people, any records in-] the
[-database are still data.

Observations are-] {+adjective 78. If we measure+}
the [-act of applying consciousness to a reality. They can-] {+noun 74s, we should+} be [-subjective and inconsistent. At the same time, researchers used-] {+able to infer what’s going on inside+} the [-term-] {+box.

We’d like this box+} to [-indicate experimental observations that are objective and provide their own context. The term observation
in the surveys suffers from-] {+have all+} the same [-traps that it does in-] {+properties everywhere. However,
since once of+} the [-interviews and-] {+purposes+} is [-worth far
more research.


Numbers as data are used by both the database designers-] {+a noun 80: if there’s new noun 80 material
being introduced ... and old noun 80 material ..., it’s not going to be

that. So, if I look at this point+} and {+it’s higher noun 74 than this point
what does that imply about+} the [-objective researchers. Numbers are either a more objective refinement of-] {+system?
Interviewer: This point being+} an [-observation or merely-] {+noun 81 versus+} a

are-] {+case between that differential

noun 82...

Participant: My interpretation+} of [-measurement, as they are-] {+this is that if we – this is time and
this is noun 74 <drawing> – if everything was uniform then those two
would be exactly+} the [-result-] {+same. If over time this happens+} and {+it’s+} the [-goal of factual inquiry.

Those who believe data are facts-] {+noun
81, we+} can [-use-] {+have higher noun 74 at+} the [-idea of numbers-] {+top and lower noun 74 at the
bottom. There are two ways+} to [-represent-] {+interpret+} this.

[-However, numbers are also the without which not of databases, being a different
order of thinking about a record. A number-] {+One is,+} in [-a database sense can be either the content-] {+my opinion,
wrong. [explanation+} of {+model] And we justify this decision from numerical modeling. We can actually then independently create+} a [-record or the sign by-] {+numerical
model+} which [-a record-] is [-stored, because a series of bits are simply
numbers. Both uses are evident and present evidence of a fascinating linguistic trap for
future research.

From-] {+consistent with that explanation. The alternate, incorrect view, is [alternate explanation] ... will give you+} the [-point of view of question-] {+right answer
most+} of [-interest 1,-] the [-surveys were-] {+time. It’s+} a [-complete
success: people demonstrated that they had philosophies-] {+nice rule+} of [-data that departed in ways
far beyond mere semantic differences over subjectivity and objectivity. Furthermore,
different roles tended-] {+thumb. noun 83s just happen+} to [-cluster around different understandings of-]
{+be different. And+} the [-term, suggesting
that educational background combined-] {+difficult thing for us was, until we constructed a
numerical model and said look: this numerical model starts off+} with
the [-current uses of-] {+... equations about+} the [-term strongly inform
meaning.


7.9 Methodological assessment
I presented two questions of interest: do people have different philosophies of data-] {+universe+} and
[-are my tools capable of capturing someone’s philosophy of data? I believe that both
questions of interest were satisfied, with my methodologies quite neatly capturing three
different schools of thought apparent in both the interview-] {+it’s entirely self consistent+}
and {+look it’s+} the [-survey. As these
philosophies roughly correspond to extant definitions in the Oxford English dictionary,

Without-] {+same result. That was something+} which [-not.


and some observations by Zins *, there are few suggestions-] {+helped us
convince people+} that [-personal bias interfered-] {+well, yes, that is consistent+} with the [-collection of evidence.

During the interviews, the SDFN process served as a fantastic tool to evoke the
participants’ philosophies. To improve the ability to probe, future researchers should
focus on a single topic area-] {+noun 60 measurements. And my explanation is not consistent+} with [-all participants exploring-] the [-same universe-] {+laws+} of [-discourse.

This uniformity may allow-] the [-application of more articulated graph theory analysis.

With a more standardized topic, not even-]

wrong if,+} other [-participants would be able to reliably
reconstruct identity from simply reading diagrams. More research-] {+things+} can [-be done-] {+also influence those noun 74s. Say if there’s
noun 61. ... And that’s when I realized a lot of people were never really+} on [-better
ways to render the SDFN. Although Graphviz does create adequate representations, it
should be possible-] {+board. Because you go+} to [-create more consistent renderings and-] a [-more intuitive labeling
scheme than currently exists.

Examining the interviews,-] {+meeting and they go, it’s just like
you’re reading ??? trails.+} I {+don’t necessarily+} believe [-they managed to accurately probe-] {+your explanation
because other things could be effecting it. You know how in any defined problem there is: these are+} the [-philosophies of data of their participants, especially through-] {+assumptions I’ve made, this is+} the
{+framework in which I+} use [-of-] {+to analyze+} the [-bubble diagram as a
tool for evoking philosophies. Each interview felt as if it was probing-] {+problem. If my assumptions
are violated, then my explanation is no longer necessarily+} the [-participant’s
philosophy of data, getting them-] {+only
explanation. You go back a little+} to [-crystallize their definitions through-] {+change+} the [-bubble diagram process,-] {+assumption: well we’ve
got a special cause. A special cause is driving this. Naah – this is where
we have some maths+} which [-created cognitive dissonance between their use and their theories
of use.

With-] {+are+} the [-discussion after-] {+noun 74 differences, we have Knowledge which is our – other people have studied+} the [-diagrams, participants usually discussed-] {+universe and we’ve
implemented models based on+} their [-internal
thoughts.-] {+studies.+} The [-interviews were not a complete success. Although it is probable that
I found each participant’s philosophy of data, the different topics of each interview
severely limit commensurability. In many ways,-] {+... models which are
based on+} the [-different topics made comparing
philosophies of data across interviews very difficult. Recursive analysis, while useful,
does not provide any kind of structure to suggest reliability. Future studies must use

162-] {+[name] equations. These are+} more [-reproducible methods of analysis or external coders to minimize or average out
bias. Recursive analysis may be profitably employed-] {+well established. I’d
class that+} as [-a coding technique,-] {+actual Knowledge. If I class that+} as [-it would
merely ask coders-] {+Knowledge, I’m using
that Knowledge+} to [-summarize small sections of interview or survey.

Examining-] {+view+} the [-surveys, I find-] {+Data+} that [-they were successful, but suffered-] {+I get+} from {+the noun 60. There are+}
some
[-large problems. The first problem is-] {+assumptions embodied in that, and I have to be aware of those. If
people reject+} that {+Knowledge or disagree with+} the [-participants did not quite understand-] {+assumptions then
it becomes really hard to agree on what’s+} the
[-intent-] {+interpretation+} of [-the survey and treated the scenarios in different ways. Furthermore, some
participants left the explanations blank, causing great difficulty in trying-] {+what’s
actually happening.

Interviewer: This is a really useful discussion. DFDs are cute, but this
is going+} to [-understand
what they meant by the terms. Future surveys will have-] {+be+} more [-clear instructions, required
descriptions of answers,-] {+interesting. So we’ve got, Data, Information,+} and [-more choices-]
{+Knowledge. They’re+} in [-the drop down box, including-] a [-“not sure.”
The surveys’ analysis did not employ any formal analysis techniques, having insufficient quantity for any statistical analysis over each survey question and insufficient
length of responses for any kind-] {+line or however you want it. Walk me through
your mental noun 97+} of [-recursive analysis. Although the responses may be
more penetrable to-] {+coming up with+} some sort of [-computerized coding technique, I saw no need for that
here, as I was not trying to make statistically rigorous statements of fact. Further studies,
however, may have the opportunity-] {+explanation+} for [-larger research sets with more tested scenarios,
enabling interesting and objective conclusions to be drawn.


7.10 Summary of Analysis-]
{+this.+} The [-three large philosophies-] {+diversion where there’s an argument. We’ll be drawing lines
in and out+} of [-data that emerge from-] {+these things, labeling lines.

Participant: Initially, we+} all [-three analyses are: data-as-communications, data-as-observations, and data-as-facts.

Data-as-communications forms a small subset and generally indicates transferred
or stored signs-] {+started ...+} with [-some relationship to computers.-] {+the same Data. We are
making these noun 60 measurements.

Interviewer:+} Data [-does-] {+here are what? Data is or are? I’m+} not [-have to be interpreted-] {+actually being
pedantic here. I’ve found instances of Data as singular, so I’m interested
in how you use Data.

Participant: Completely inconsistently. In this case, we wouldn’t refer+}
to [-be real:-] it [-exists-] as [-stored signs, and that creates its reality.

Data-as-observations is a broad category suggesting that data is-] {+Data. We may call them Data points.

Interviewer: So you start by getting Data points.

Participant: Originally+} the [-product of
observations that sentient creatures make of their environments.-] {+noun 63 didn’t even measure it.+} It [-is subjective-] {+was originally a dial,+} and

[-163

requires filtering-] {+a guy had+} to [-winnow out interesting data from-] {+go and read it once in+} the [-huge mess of data sleeting
around us.

Data-as-facts is a narrower category, indicating that a piece of data is-] {+morning and
once in the afternoon. Because it was+} a [-scientific
fact, used for-] {+retrofit in+} the [-revelation of knowledge, discovering how-] {+system. And
later we connected it to+} the [-universe works by looking-] {+noun 63. Those are noun 74s I measured+} at [-the relationships-]
{+known locations. At known locations+} and [-arrangements of things.


7.10.1 Links with the literature
There are two authors whose research into-] {+times. Initially we all agreed
what that meant. Later on we began to fight over whether or not+} the [-various relationships of data, information,
and knowledge presented useful assistance in my analysis. The first-]
{+Noun 4+} is [-Dr. Ilkka Tuomi,
who articulates-] a [-reverse hierarchy-] {+good Noun 4.

Interviewer: So you’re measuring noun 74 at a location and time. Is
there a consistent definition+} of [-data, information,-] {+noun 74,+} and [-knowledge,-] {+where does it come from?
An operationalization, say. It’s not+} a [-hierarchy-] {+theoretical definition. When we
use noun 74, we are referring+} to
[-which at least one of my participants subscribes.-] {+this.


...

Interviewer: So we’re measuring gauge noun 74.+} The [-second researcher is Dr. Chaim
Zins, whose surveys in many ways validated Ackoff’s “standard” hierarchy with his
experiments, despite showing that there are many definitions-] {+concept+} of [-data, information, and
knowledge.


7.10.1.1 Zins’ concepts
Zins performed-] {+Gauge
noun 74 is what here, if anything?
Participant: That would be Knowledge.

Interviewer: So really, we have+} a [-“collective knowledge mapping”-] {+Knowledge start+} of [-a number-] {+what? I’m trying
to get at the really basic assumptions.

Participant: At the level+} of [-researchers using a
critical Delphi methodology over three rounds of research [60–63]. Although his approach
looked at definitions directly, he found two different concepts of data and a similar
ontological split over subjectivity, objectivity, and communication.

While I-] {+your standard position 58 they+} have [-utilized his works for justification of my literature, I did not closely
examine his conclusions-] to [-avoid biasing my analyses. Zins,-]
{+take a great many things+} in [-2003, identified areas of
difference similar to those I identified [62]:
Six distinctive concepts. Having established the distinction between
the subjective and the universal domains, we-] {+their education on face value. And it’s an
assertion.

Interviewer: You would assert that these assertions+} are [-in-] {+Data, Information, Knowledge?
Participant: Knowledge.

Interviewer: So these assertions, as Knowledge, form what?
Participant: They form+} a [-position-] {+context in which+} to [-define

the three key concepts data, information, and knowledge. In fact,-] {+view...

Interviewer: Context. Starting here from Knowledge, it produces a
context for your Data?
Participant: Yeah.

Interviewer: Is there an incoming thing for Knowledge here? We have
Knowledge which produces context for data. Is there anything which
informs which context+} we {+produce?
Participant: We’ll take the view people have: it is a modern western
educational system. Background education, everyone should+} have [-six concepts to define, divided into two distinctive sets-] {+that.

Interviewer: Background education produces Knowledge, Knowledge
is or produces context?
Participant: It produces context.

Interviewer: What is that production – where are we getting context
from in terms+} of [-three.

One set relates to the subjective domain,-] {+production Knowledge? We’ve got background education+} and {+we somehow get context from that.

Participant: So what else produces+} the [-other-to the universal domain. [Data-Information-Knowledge] in-] {+context?
Interviewer: Yes. What’s+} the [-subjective domain.

In-] {+transition phase there?
Participant: That context together with what I learn about+} the [-subjective domain, data are-] {+noun
60 has to be applied to this particular problem.

Interviewer: So problem localization?
Participant: Yep.

Interviewer: What is problem localization?
Participant: That’s your initial study/investigation of+} the [-sensory stimuli,-] {+issue at hand.

Interviewer: This study of issue at hand is+} which [-we perceive through our senses.-] {+category?
Participant: That’s collecting+} Information [-is the meaning-] {+about it. The study+} of [-these sensory
stimuli (i.e., the empirical perception). For example,-] the [-noises that I
hear are data.-]
{+problem at hand produces Information.


Interviewer:+} The [-meaning of these noises (e.g., a running car engine)
is information. Still, there is another alternative-] {+Information, combined with background Knowledge,
produces context?
Participant: yeah.

Interviewer: So we have,+} as [-to how to define
these two concepts-which seems even better. Data are sense stimuli,
or their meaning (i.e.,-] the [-empirical perception). Accordingly, in-] {+two inputs to this problem, we have
background education and+} the
[-example above,-] {+study of+} the [-loud noises, as well as-] {+problem at hand. Are there
any other inputs to this problem?
Participant: No.

Interviewer: now+} the [-perception-] {+study+} of {+the background at hand produces Information. Is there+} a [-running
car engine, are data. Information-] {+transmutation of the study, or+} is [-empirical knowledge. Accordingly,
in-] {+this line+} the [-example above,-] {+study
of+} the [-knowledge that-] {+problem at hand?
Participant: Not sure.

Interviewer: Is+} the [-engine is now on and-] {+study of+} the [-car is leaving-] {+problem at hand Information or+} is [-information, since it-]
{+compiled from stuff into Information?
Participant: It’s probably compiled from stuff.

Interviewer: So the study+} is [-empirically based.-] {+also+} Information [-is a type of knowledge, rather than an intermediate stage between
data and knowledge. Knowledge is a thought in-] {+itself?
Participant: It generates Information.

Interviewer: so we have+} the [-individual’s mind,-] {+study of the problem at hand+} which {+generates Information. This Information generated+} is [-characterized by-] {+what?
Participant: In our worldview,+} the [-individual’s justifiable belief that it-] {+difference between Information and
Knowledge,+} is
[-true. It can be empirical-] {+that Knowledge implies some level of understanding.

I go off+} and [-non-empirical, as in-] {+I get+} the [-case of logical-] {+noun 60 drawings+} and [-mathematical knowledge (e.g., “every triangle has three sides”),
religious knowledge (e.g., “God exists”), philosophical knowledge (e.g.,
“Cogito ergo sum”),-] {+operational noun 116s,+}
and [-the like. Note-] {+I review all of+} that [-knowledge-] {+and I distill from that what+} is the [-content
of a thought-] {+important
Knowledge which I hold+} in [-the individual’s mind,-] {+my head.

Interviewer: Let’s talk about that. You’re distilling Knowledge+} which
{+you hold in your head.

Participant: I’m assembling a Knowledge framework in my head from
Information.

Interviewer: What+} is [-characterized by-] the
[-individual’s justifiable belief-] {+purpose of this framework?
Participant: To help me understand Data+} that [-it is true, while “knowing”-] {+I receive in the future.

Interviewer: So what you’re telling me+} is [-a state-] {+that from the study+} of
[-mind which is characterized by-] the [-three conditions: (1)-]
{+problem at hand and from background education you’re creating a
contextual framework?
Participant: Yeah.

Interviewer: does+} the [-individual
believe[s] that it-] {+contextual framework do anything other than
provide context?
Participant: Not really.

Interviewer: So this study of the problem at hand as Information plus
background education as knowledge combine to create a contextual
framework. This contextual framework+} is [-true, (2) S/he can justify it,-] {+Knowledge+} and [-(3) It is true, or-] it is
[-appear to be true.

[Data-Information-Knowledge] in the universal domain. In the universal domain, data, information, and knowledge are human artifacts.

They are represented by empirical signs (i.e., signs that one can sense
through his/her senses). They can take on diversified forms such-] {+used+} as [-engraved signs, painted forms, printed words, digital signals, light beams,
sound waves, and the like. Universal data, universal information, and
universal knowledge mirror their cognitive counterparts. Meaning, in-]
{+a basis for telling you what Data to collect? or for you to understand+}
the [-objective domain data are sets-] {+collected data?

Participant: Both. there is lots+} of [-signs-] {+Data+} that [-represent empirical
stimuli or perceptions, information-] {+I could be looking at, and
my context+} is {+my filter, because+} a [-set-] {+lot+} of [-signs, which represent
empirical knowledge, and knowledge-] {+it+} is {+not important.

Interviewer: Can you think of+} a [-set-] {+useful nature analogy for this?
Participant: A molecular sieve?
Interviewer: A molecular sieve, fantastic.

Participant: It’s just an ordinary filter.

Interviewer: So the Knowledge acts as a filter? And the stuff going
through the filter is Data?
Participant: Yeah.

Interviewer: When you say the stuff going through the filter is Data,
give me an example+} of [-signs that represent-] {+something that’s trapped by+} the [-meaning (or-] {+filter and something that’s passed by+} the [-content)-] {+filter.

Participant: The vibration amplitude+} of [-thoughts that-] the [-individual justifiably
believes-] {+fans+} that [-they-] are [-true.

Signs Versus Meaning. Defining-] {+feeding+} the [-Data-I-Knowledge phenomena as
sets-]
{+system. It is part+} of [-signs needs-] {+the noun 60 and it is peripherally related+} to [-be refined. There-] {+this
problem, but it’s not important enough to actually pass through the
filter. Whereas the actual flow through that fan which+} is [-a fundamental distinction
between documented (i.e., written, spoken, or physically expressed)
propositions and meanings. “E = MC2”,“E = MC2”, and “E = MC2” are
not three different types of knowledge. These are three different sets
of signs that represent the same meaning. In other words, they are
three different utterances-] {+also an input+}
of the [-same knowledge. Knowledge, in the
collective domain, is-] {+system, this far more important input, will pass through+} the [-meaning that is represented by written-]
{+filter,+} and
[-spoken statements (i.e., sets-] {+I will try to analyze it in light+} of [-symbols). However, because we cannot
perceive with our senses the meaning itself, which is an abstract entity,

we can relate only-] {+???.

Interviewer: In order for you+} to {+analyze something that’s passed through+}
the [-sets-] {+filter, is there some function+} of [-signs (i.e., written, spoken,-] {+observation going on+} or [-physically
expressed propositions), which represent it. Apparently, it is more
useful to relate to-] {+has+} the [-data, information, and knowledge as sets-]
{+observation happened upstream+} of [-signs
rather than-] {+the filter?
Participant: The observation happened upstream.

Interviewer: Context filter+} as [-meaning and its building blocks.


My work profoundly agrees-] {+Knowledge?
Participant: Yeah. I’d love for you to have an interview+} with [-the discoveries he made, though my research
focuses far more on data-] {+[name].

You could have many interesting discussions about what is context+} and [-differentiates three different orders-]
{+whether or not I’ve actually observed that or not.

Interviewer: So we have observations here. Observations+} of [-data-] {+what?
Participant: In our world, they’d have+} to [-his two.


7.10.1.2 Trading Zone
Also-] {+be observations+} of [-interest-] {+physical
states.

Interviewer: Observations of physical things? Go into this noun 97? An
observation+} is [-the way that the interviewees demonstrated the idea-] {+what?
Participant: An observation is a measurement+} of {+some kind.

Interviewer: So+} a [-trading zone.

As Galison defines it [64],
These considerations so exacerbated-] {+measurement is generated and flows into+} the [-problem [of physicists communicating] that it seemed as if any two cultures (groups with very
different systems of symbols-] {+filter.

The filter then winnows out irrelevant observations...+} and [-procedures-] {+then we have
relevant observations.

Participant: This is the important thing. Because people hold different
contexts+} for [-their manipulation)
would-] {+these reasons. That includes what may or may not+} be [-condemned to pass-]
{+superfluous around them. And chuck out the stuff that really matters.

Interviewer: So+} one [-another without any possibility-] {+area+} of [-significant interactions. Here we can learn from-] {+conflict is+} the [-anthropologists who
regularly study unlike cultures-] {+context filter. And+} that [-do interact, most notably by trade.

Two groups-] {+context filter conflict+} can [-agree on rules of exchange even if they ascribe utterly-] {+come from either+} different [-significance to-] {+priorities, a different
background education, or a different study?

Participant: Yes.

Interviewer: Are there any other sources which perturb+} the [-objects being exchanged; they may even
disagree on-] {+context
filter?
Participant: People’s political agenda.

Interviewer: Where should I put+} the [-meaning-] {+box?
Participant: I guess it’s Knowledge.

Interviewer: What kind+} of [-the exchange process-] {+Knowledge? Why is it Knowledge?
Participant: It exists by+} itself. [-Nonetheless,
the trading partners-] {+It’s not Information which you+} can [-hammer out a local coordination despite vast
global differences. In an even more sophisticated way, cultures-] {+tie
down. A person may be...+} in [-interaction frequently establish contact languages, systems-] {+all cases+} of [-discourse

can’t measure+} the [-most function-specific jargons, through semispecific pidgins,-] {+things we actually want+} to [-full-fledged creoles rich enough-] {+measure. I want+} to [-support activities
as complex as poetry and metalinguistic reflection. The anthropological picture is relevant here. For in focusing on local coordination,
rather than on global meaning, one can understand-] {+know
what+} the [-way engineers,
experimenters, and theorist interact. At last,-] {+adjective 78 is.+} I [-come-] {+want+} to {+know what+} the [-connection between place, exchange, and knowledge production. Instead of
looking at laboratories simply as the places at which experimental information and strategies are generated, my concern is with the site
– partly symbolic and partly spatial – at which the local coordination
between beliefs and action takes place. It-] {+adjective 79+} is [-a domain-] {+there.

Guess what,+} I [-call the trading
zone.


The requirement of locally true definitions applies across the original trading
zones between cultures and, more interestingly, to the various cultures-] {+can’t measure either+} of [-physics. In
the interviews,-] {+those two things. Alright, what
can+} I [-noticed some evidence for trading zones in the interview material.

Specifically, when the various participants referred-] {+measure? I want+} to {+measure+} the [-terms “raw data” and “derived

data,” they seemed to be using a local definition of data that did not correspond with
their own philosophy, strictly speaking. Instead, they were referring-] {+noun 74. That’s going+} to [-various sensor
products-] {+piss off+}
that [-were, indeed, “raw data” to every member of the team.

The extension of the Galisonian trading zone concept is not new-] {+guy, because he’s got+} to [-this research.

In fact, business researchers have used the idea of trading zones-] {+put a hole in his noun 60+} and [-some sophisticated
ideas of boundary demarcation for quite some time,-] {+it’s+} going [-so far as-] to [-use graphs and
knowledge maps (as opposed-]
{+corrode at that point. His political agenda is+} to [-my SDFN)-] {+stop me. He wants+} to [-identify different groups. Wilson and Herndl
use this methodology when they describe their understanding of knowledge maps and
trading zones [65]:
The knowledge maps we created and shared with project participants
encouraged cooperation and mutual understanding rather than-]
{+solve+} the
[-slash-and-burn rhetoric of demarcation events. When technical experts discuss-] {+problem. He works for+} the [-parts-] {+same company as me+} and [-subfunctions they have made, they get-] {+we want+}
to
[-describe their local practice, explain their knowledge, and open up
their community-specific lexicon within the ecological relations of
the boundary object. As they trace the lines connecting the boxes on
the knowledge map, participants articulate communities of practice:
each distinct but also connected through-] {+make money. But he doesn’t want to put holes in his noun 60. So
he’s got conflicting things: help make money, make his life easier.

Interviewer: So+} the [-boundary object. Because
it-] {+political agenda+} is [-plastic and robust, the knowledge map balances the demands-] {+basically an estimation+} of
[-identification-] {+personal needs,+} and [-division in Burke’s terms. As boundary objects, the
knowledge maps help to create a rhetorical space-] {+this is Knowledge?
Participant: For+} that {+actor, yes.

Interviewer: Now you said it can’t be tied down like Information can?
Participant: Yes, because it’s fluid.

Interviewer: Now background education+} is [-best understood through Galison’s notion of the trading zone.


This methodological description-] {+also fluid?
Participant: Well, people will learn more. But they could be misapplying some+} of their [-work-] {+education. They could review that...

Interviewer: It+} is [-focused in the anthropological
study of finding sub-cultures, rather than language differences. Despite this, my analysis
produced many of the same results as theirs (methodologically speaking, if not with
respect to content) because both my research and theirs tried to understand different
philosophies/cultures with the metaphor of trading zones.

Just as they extend the concept of trading zone-] {+also fluid?
Participant:+} to [-consultants on the Washington
beltway creating local definitions for a program already approved-] {+an extent, hopefully less.

Interviewer: Whereas Information’s not fluid?
Participant: Information should be more concrete.

Interviewer: When you say more concrete, what do you mean?
Participant: First off, Information is+} by {+more concrete – in+} the [-Pentagon,-] {+hierarchy.

Data is concrete. It might be –+} I
[-extend the idea to how different philosophies of data interact. Their use of Graphvizgenerated graphs as talking points to determine cultural ramifications matches my ex-

perience of using said graphs to generate philosophical insight:

particular time. We might argue what it means, which+} is [-crucial to-] {+Knowledge,
but it is what it is. But+} the
[-emergence of something like Galison’s (1997) trading zone. Participants
develop Galison’s “possibility-] {+Information... I’ve reviewed a whole pile+}

803) through the map as it emerges. The map continually structures-] {+things. Those are Information sources, they are – it’s clear+} how {+I

less concrete.

Interviewer: Because+} the [-team understands and explains-] {+provenance may not be clear
Participant: It may not be clear.

Interviewer: is+} the [-project.


The differences between their study-] {+nature different? Or is just a difference in reliability?

Participant: Between Data+} and [-mine are quite pronounced, although-] {+Information? There’s always some overlap, so it’s not+} just {+provenance. ??? Data would be a nice discrete thing.

That I could tie down. The Information ??? could be viewed+} as [-they observed different groups creating temporary trading zones through the use-] {+a collection+} of [-knowledge maps, I observed-] {+data.

Interviewer: So Data is+} something [-similar with the pidgin concepts-] {+that could be tied down. Information
is a collection+} of [-“derived
data” and “raw data.” While waiting for interviews,-] {+data?
Participant: It can be.

Interviewer: when you say tied down, what do you mean?
Participant:+} I [-saw researchers passing around
sheets of paper with pictures-] {+can specify what, where, when. Probably what where
when would define a piece+} of [-phenomena on them and referring to them explicitly as
raw data. This practice almost certainly serves to inform-] {+that. What+} the [-local definitions and create-] {+measure of it was, its
location at+} the [-trading zone necessary for successful research practice.

Interviewer: When you say tied down, its tied down in terms of provenance? reliability?
Participant: Yep.

Interviewer: Information+} is [-the set-] {+a collection+} of [-interpretive filters-] {+Data. The noun 97 of collecting it is+} a [-recipient applies to incoming communication, thereby changing its meaning based on the biases applied by-] {+function of something we’ll get to. But+} the [-recipient,
shared understanding, and cultural mores.-] {+collecting it

Participant:+} It [-was originally used-] {+doesn’t reduce its reliability.

Interviewer: what does it change?
Participant: It places its – it begins+} to [-explore the effects-] {+place it in a context+} of

things. So you’ll often have conflicting data. They’re fine by themselves,+}
but [-it can also be an interesting way-] {+when viewed together in my collection of Information, now ???

operate effectively.

or written-] {+we using context+} in [-conjunction with-] a [-specific evaluative accent. There-] {+different..?
Participant: This+} is [-no
such thing-] {+a different context. Probably there’s like – I have to
decide what to look at.

Interviewer: In this case, context+} as {+what?
Participant: This is context as relevance.

Interviewer: when we’re using one+} word [-without evaluative accent.

What-] {+in different ways, we can just
do "as foo". So we’ve got context as relevance filter, winnowing out
relevant observations. We... combine?
Participant: Combine those observations
Interviewer: We combine these observations into what? More Data?
Information?

Participant: Into a Data set.

Interviewer: We combine Data points into a Data set. This Data set+} is [-the nature of this accent, and how does it relate to the referential side-]
{+Data, Information, or Knowledge?
Participant: It’s still Data.

Interviewer: So we’ve got a data set+} of [-meaning?-] {+relevant observations?+} The [-most obvious, but at the same time, the most
superficial aspect of social value judgment incorporated in the word is-] {+fact+}
that [-which is conveyed with-] {+we have a set here. What produces+} the [-help-] {+structure+} of [-expressive intonation. In most
cases, intonation is determined by-] the [-immediate situation and often

by its most ephemeral circumstances. To be sure, intonation of-] {+set? Why
do we say that it’s+} a [-more
substantial kind is also possible. ...

All six [uses of-] {+set?
Participant: We can say it’s+} a [-single word in-] {+set, because we constructed our filter...

It’s+} a [-removed quote] by the artisans are
different, despite the fact that they all consisted-] {+set+} of [-one and-] {+things related to+} the [-same
word. That word, in this instance was essentially-] {+problem at hand.

Interviewer: So their+} only [-a vehicle for
intonation. The conversation was conducted in intonations expressing
the value judgments of the speakers.


Beyond the verbal intonation-] {+relationship so far+} is [-context and use. In a more modern sense, people

of different generations use what amounts to steganographic * encryption in-] their [-status

messages, relying on context and the source of quoted material-] {+relationship+} to [-produce different
meaning for different people.

An instance of-]
{+problem...?
Participant: If+} this [-social steganography appears in the following example to pass
different meaning through a Facebook post to the subject’s friends and mother:
When Carmen broke up with her boyfriend, she “wasn’t in-] {+is+} the [-happiest
state.” The breakup happened while she was-] {+first time we’re doing it, yeah. But later+} on [-a school trip and her
mother was already nervous. Initially, Carmen was going to mark-] {+it
should be better than that.

Interviewer: But+} the
[-breakup with lyrics from a song that she had been listening to,-] {+Data points don’t have any relationship amongst
themselves?
Participant: They will,+} but
[-then she realized that the lyrics were quite depressing and worried
that-] {+I can’t do this – it’s hard to do abstractly.

There will be subsets with multiple interrelationships.

Interviewer: So we’ve got sets as relevancy, but we also have sets as
relationships. Set relationships are considered to be what? Data, Information, or Knowledge?
Participant: Information. Set relationship –+} if [-her mom read them, she’d “have-] {+we know+} a [-heart attack and think that
something-] {+priori yes,
noun 74+} is [-wrong.” She decided not-] {+related+} to [-post the lyrics. Instead, she
posted lyrics-] {+Noun 12, that’s Information. ??? But it may have
to be something I have to discover. It depends where I – where that
relationship comes from. Sometimes I can just know where it comes+}
from [-Monty Python’s “Always Look on the Bright Side of
Life.” This strategy was effective. Her mother wrote her-] {+or I have to discover it through further manipulation.

Interviewer: That’s relevant. If we know+} a [-note saying-] {+priori, we get+} that [-she seemed happy-] {+from background education?+} which [-made her laugh. But her closest friends
knew-] {+is then turned into Information? What is+} that [-this song appears in-]
{+transformation right there? We’ve got lots of background education,
from that we extract Information?
Participant: Uh-huh
Interviewer: The Information is that there is a relationship here? So,
we have relevant observations and data sets. Some data sets have relational context internal to+} the [-movie when-] {+set. Others have context external too+} the [-characters are about
to be killed. They reached out to her immediately-]
{+problem. Well, all have context external+} to [-see how she was
really feeling.


The use of “Always Look on-] the [-Bright Side of Life,” as Boyd discusses, is-] {+problem. Some have
internal context based on prior Knowledge turned into Information.

Given that we have some that don’t have+} an [-example
of a successful steganographic encoding of a message. Her friends-] {+internal context that we
have to discover, we+} could [-decrypt-] {+classify this as+} the

Interviewer: Yeah.

Participant: This same problem? Ultimately, I’m interested in the adjective 78 and distribution+} of [-culture with Carmen,-] {+that noun 60. There are+} a [-shared

Although-] {+do with: what

are [-specifically interpreted by the recipient of any communication, in-] {+changing and we don’t really know what’s going on. That’s actually+} the
[-recipient’s context.

Literal intonation has very little-] {+key we’re trying+} to [-do with the philosophy of data. Yet the term-] {+address: what research+} is [-used in everyday, technical, engineering,-] {+trying to do+} and [-scientific speech. The full weight of-]
{+what+} the
[-evaluative accent, as seen in-] {+– technology department solve today’s problems, solve next

{+same thing. That’s+} the [-use of context and role.

While originally it was seen as way-] {+implication that we’re actually getting+} to [-frame ideologies; almost a post-hermeneutic way
of explaining some failures of Marxism [68]. The idea of an evaluative accent can be
combined profitably with-] the [-philosophy-] {+–
we’re aiming towards laws+} of {+nature. What is actually+} the [-trading zone.

The idea of an evaluative accent corresponds well with-] {+real reason?
As opposed to "How can I get a useful working model that allows us
to make more money?" That’s more+} the [-idea of-] {+technology position 58’s job.

Which means we’re going to have overlap and conflict because we have
different agendas.

Interviewer: You mentioned prediction.

Participant: Why do I want to predict?
Interviewer: a) why, but b) how do you predict?
Participant: If I had+} a [-trading zone.

The construction-] {+causal model+} of [-misunderstanding the same language could hardly be-] the [-result of-] {+factors that control+} a [-simple linguistic misunderstanding. When a data-as-subjective-observation person
says “data”-] {+variable
that we’re going+} to [-a data-as-objective-hard-numbers person, both of them are using a “functionally correct” definition, a definition shared by many people. They are encountering

a trading zone. As Galison states, “In-] {+observe,+} the [-trading zone, where two webs meet, there
are knots, local-] {+reason I want to know the noun 74s is
that it’s telling me about adjective 78. I want to control the adjective
78. if I know that these center 5 things have positive+} and [-dense sets of quasi-rigid connections-] {+negative
influences on+} that [-can be identified with
partially autonomous clusters of actions-] {+adjective 78,+} and [-beliefs.” [64] My identification of different
philosophies of data certainly corresponds with these diverse beliefs. And-] {+I want adjective 78 to be low, I will
try to select+} those [-beliefs
inform the evaluative accents-] {+5 things such that I make it tend to be low. That’s why
I want to be able to predict. So+} that [-people use-] when they [-use-] {+say: "We’re thinking of
buying this new thing.."+} and [-receive-] {+I’m saying "don’t do that because it’s high

in this and this will make that bad and we’ll make less money." That’s
why I want to predict.

Interviewer: A predictive model is what? Knowledge, I, Data?
Participant: It’s+} the [-term “data.”
While different uses-] {+embodiment+} of [-data may-] {+our Knowledge.

Interviewer: This embodiment of Knowledge is what?
Participant: I can’t+} be [-boundary objects for-] more [-profound cultures, [69–72] this minimal investigation can scarcely provide an anthropological look
into the various research cultures in existence. I can present research into-] {+concrete than that, it’s+} the [-intentional
creation-] {+embodiment+} of [-a local language.-]
{+Knowledge. It should be an algorithm.

Interviewer: Does an algorithm even feature on this spectrum?
Participant: An algorithm should be Knowledge.

Interviewer: Why?
Participant:+} The [-use-] {+noun 97+} of [-“raw”-] {+understanding is the noun 129 of Knowledge. Because when I understand the problem,+} and [-“derived” as a semiotic prefix presents
a linguistic indicator to switch evaluative accents to recipients who are aware-] {+I can specify: "you
take these things and you do these operations on them and the outcome+}
of that
[-indicator. The practice-] {+will tell you something." basic way+} of [-forming local trading zones, by repeatedly presenting symbols-] {+looking at an algorithm.

Will tell you what’s going+} to [-the other party-] {+happen+} in [-an environment where people are aware that bridging must occur [64],-] {+this other thing. The Knowledge+}
is [-the non-ideological practice of causing sufficient cognitive dissonance in the
recipients for them-] {+here, but I have+} to [-“bud off”-] {+express it someway. An algorithm is+} a [-new evaluative accent-] {+way+} for [-interpreting-] {+me
to document+} the [-incoming
sign-set.

The evaluative accent-] {+Knowledge I’ve developed.

Interviewer: An algorithm is an expression+} of [-the local definition-] {+Knowledge which is itself
Knowledge.

Participant: I’m running out+} of {+words.

Interviewer: Feel free to make new ones. How does Information ...

inform your ... It looks like we’ve got+} a [-word can be understood in the
context-] {+couple types+} of [-Peircian semiotics. As Aktin notes [73]:-] {+Knowledge here.

We’ve context and we’ve got predictive. Are they different?
Participant:+} In [-Peirce’s theory-] the [-sign relation is a triadic relation that is a special
species-] {+view+} of the [-genus:-] {+algorithm, when you’re providing context to+} the [-representing relation. Whenever-] {+algorithm, you’re just providing+} the [-representing relation has an instance, we find one thing (the ‘object’) being
represented by (or: in) another thing (the ‘representamen’) and being
represented to (or: in)-] {+inputs into the algorithm. Which produces+} a [-third thing (the ‘interpretant’).


The interpretant serves as the developed representation of meaning. Thus,-] {+prediction.

Interviewer: Do+} we [-can
understand local trading zones to be the product of evaluative accents present in the
interpretant [74].


7.11 Conclusion
My findings fundamentally agree with and extend both Chaim Zins’ work and the definitions-] {+have a type+} of [-the Oxford English Dictionary. While more research is necessary, there is little
doubt in my mind-] {+Knowledge that’s not algorithmic?
Participant: Yeah, stuff+} that I [-have answered-] {+just know.

Interviewer: what is+} the [-two questions of interest:
•
•

•

•
•

I have discovered philosophies of data-] {+relationship between stuff+} that [-profoundly differ from each other-] {+you just know+}
and
[-that agree with other, related research.

Some evidence points-] {+algorithmic Knowledge?
Participant: I tried+} to {+say that algorithmic Knowledge... having developed a Knowledge framework about something, how do I write down,
tell someone else, tell a computer about it.

Interviewer: Good point. What’s computer code?
Participant: In a lisp sense?
Interviewer: Let’s work from+} the [-existence of trading zones between different philosophies-] {+trivial sense, back.

Participant: In the trivial sense, it’s a series+} of [-data. The use-] {+instructions that you’re
asking the computer to perform.

Interviewer: so each+} of {+these instructions, does any instruction fall
under this chart?

Participant: An instruction tells+} the [-terms “raw data” and “derived data”-] {+computer to operate on Data+} in
the [-interviews
strongly suggests this. However, more research is necessary before there is any useful evidence for how trading zones form with philosophies of-] {+computer.

Interviewer: So it’s+} data [-and what impact
evaluative accents have-] {+operation. Is the instruction itself Data?
Participant: Well it certainly can be, depending+} on [-data and misunderstandings.

There-] {+what your code+} is [-evidence for both Ackoff’s and Tuomi’s hierarchies of data, information, and
knowledge. Ackoff’s work has penetrated modern thinking, especially management
thinking, quite deeply. At the same time, the more “modern” relativistic philosophies of science seem to correspond quite well with Tuomi’s philosophy. Far more
evidence-]
{+doing? Self-modifying code.

Interviewer: So code can modify itself, this modified code+} is [-needed-] {+Data?
Participant: Instructions.

Interviewer: This modified code is instructions, is Data?
Participant: Are we talking Von Neumann architecture, are we talking
LISP? Or are we going+} to [-create suggested “trading zones” that can bridge these and
other discovered philosophies.

Some indications hint that-] {+say a procedural language on a Von Neumann
arch? I’m being a pain I know.

Interviewer: First question is: do we need to differentiate architectures?
Participant: Well, if we’re going to talk about something that’s a purely
functional system. Where’s+} the [-philosophy-] {+state+} of [-data is a factor-] {+the system? Well, it’s+} in [-database design,
though-] the
current [-evidence cannot create useful rules for database changes based
on the recipient’s philosophy-] {+state+} of [-data. More implementation research is needed here,
as well.

Both-] the [-interviews-] {+functions. They’re all+} and the [-surveys discovered different philosophies of data, but not
without failures. More research-] {+data+} is [-necessary to explore the utility of my methodology-] {+immutable,+}
and [-to refine it for-] {+it’s a+} different [-purposes.


8 Applications
My research must demonstrate practical applications for other people. In order for my
methodology to be useful, and for the philosophy-] {+way+} of [-data to be applicable, there must be
applications in-] {+thinking about+} the [-real-] {+problem. If we leave it
in a nice procedural+} world [-of both metholodolgy-] {+where Data resides in either memory or in
registers+} and [-analysis. This chapter explores
those applications.-] I [-demonstrate that the SDFN can be used beyond exploring the philosophy-] {+carry out operations by moving Data from place to place
or combining two pieces to produce another piece+} of [-data-] {+Data. Then I have
instructions+} and [-some practical consequences of people considering-] {+I have Data. In a functional architecture – let’s say
LISP. Let’s not talk FORTH. I’ve had limited experience with stack based
languages.

Interviewer: The real question is: when does stuff in a computer become not-Data? Where does computer based stuff escape+} the [-philosophy of
data. Each section-] {+classification+} of [-this chapter stands alone and is-] {+Data?
Participant: Well, that’s+} a [-potential application for the SDFN
or-] {+meaning we ascribe to it. At+} the [-philosophy-] {+end+} of [-data.

The SDFN-] {+the
day everything+} is a [-methodology for exploring flows between entities and peoples’ categorization of those flows. Application-] {+stream+} of {+bits. So+} this [-methodology may allow businesses to
become more efficient and present academic researchers with new techniques for understanding how research participants differentiate concepts. Application of-] {+bit stream is Data. It depends
on+} the [-philosophy-] {+level+} of [-data may enable better designs by database designers-] {+abstraction you’ve chosen.

Interviewer: At what level of abstraction does that change? Is there
a point where we get more+} and [-human-computer interface
designers. It is, in general, useful-] {+more abstract and suddenly those bit
streams cease become data.

Participant: At a certain point, I’m able+} to [-everyone needing-] {+attach meaning+} to [-communicate “data” across
disparate groups, as it raises awareness of-] {+it. When
I’m looking at a character on+} the [-different interpretations-] {+screen, from the screen’s point+} of [-data,-]
{+view, some bits came along+} and [-can
thereby reduce mistakes, errors,-] {+it does stuff. And you have an A. Great.

I look at those bits whether they’re on or off+} and [-misunderstandings.


8.1 Usage-] {+say that’s an "a" At
that point, I’ve got some Information.

Interviewer: So your perception+} of [-the SDFN
Throughout my analysis are hints as to how-] {+a character on a screen is not Data,
but Information
Participant: It can be. If+} I [-could use-] {+was looking at DNA sequences, that "a" is just
one of+} the [-SDFN Methodology for purposes
other than discovering participants’ philosophies-] {+base pairs. And that would be a representation+} of [-data.-] {+Data.

Interviewer:+} This [-section takes some-] {+representation+} of {+Data is itself Data, Information,
Knowledge?

Participant: It’s just a representation.

Interviewer: is+} the
[-more interesting possible uses in different fields and documents them.

Both academia and business can profit from the adoption of-] {+representation significant?
Participant: How something’s represented is+} the [-SDFN. The methodology-] {+significant act. Data+}
is [-one of many discovery methodologies, but its simplicity and definition-] {+represented+} by [-cate-

gorization may be a useful mind-mapping solution or a way-] {+something which is significant.

Interviewer: So you as position 90 looking at computer screen see Information, but not Data, because you’re looking at representations of
Data?
Participant: I will call it – it will depend on how people decide+} to [-construct-] {+look at
it. if they’re just looking at+} a [-trading zone
between disciplines-] {+number in a text box, And that’s changing+}
with [-vastly different jargons.


8.1.1 Academic Applications of-] {+time or they’re looking at a trend line – it’s+} the [-SDFN
One-] {+same underlying
measurements+} of the [-most important uses-] {+noun 60. They’ll react to them differently.

Interviewer: Is how they react a function+} of {+something?
Participant: It will depend on all+} the [-SDFN is as a meaning-making methodology: one-] {+things+} that [-researchers can use-] {+are personal drivers
on them. If it was something they were trying+} to [-extract-] {+control and they’re
just looking at+} the [-operational meaning from terms-] {+current number, and they go yes, that’s less than my
current set point limit. I’m happy. They’re living+} in [-an interview.

The success of Question of interest 2 indicates that the categorization focused by-] the
[-SDFN is now-] {+now. If they
have+} a [-tested and valid way-] {+trend plot+} of [-probing operational definitions.


As a meaning-making activity, the repeated categorization creates-] {+it+} and [-then resolves cognitive dissonance in the mind of the participant. The participant categorizes
flows according to how-] they [-use each term, as-] {+see that it’s under the set point limit
but increasing, I’m worried. As+} opposed to [-their theoretical definition
of the term. Subsequent thought about-] {+previously: "Oh, fine. Is it
going up or down, I don’t know, it depends on my context."
Interviewer: How does Data become Information?
Participant: When my theories?? get classified into data sets, collections...

Interviewer: You have+} the [-categorization then introduces a conflict
between how they categorized-] {+Data sets,+} and [-how they think about it. Researchers can use this
research anyplace where discovering operational definitions of categorizable terms is
important.

When-] the [-cognitive dissonance develops, participants try-] {+Data sets with relationships
are Information?
Participant: Yeah.

Interviewer: These Data sets that become Information, what happens+}
to [-relieve the mental
pressure through discussion. This discussion, more than the SDFN, is-] {+them?
Participant: In an ideal world, I’d write+} the [-real value-] {+perfect technical report
which would form part+} of the
[-methodology. By helping the participant articulate their differences of definition,-] {+institutions Knowledge+} and
[-by recording that articulation, a researcher can capture actual operational definitions as
the participant understands them. The process exposes how the participant thinks-] {+everybody
would read it+} and
[-their internal conflicts to-] {+we’d all have pushed back+} the [-view-] {+frontiers+} of [-the interviewer.

The SDFN provides-] {+Knowledge+}
a [-framework for the interview discussion. While many interview
frameworks exist, especially knowledge-mapping frameworks [75], the SDFN may offer-] {+small amount.

Interviewer: Let’s unpack that. Candide’s universe, we’ve got el dorado.

You have Information this information is your Data set.

Participant: Yeah
Interviewer: You then write+} a
[-more practical access-] {+technical report. Is this technical report
Information?
Participant: It probably is Information.

Interviewer: Does it represent Information?
Participant: It should represent Knowledge. It depends. In an ideal
world, you’ve carried out a study, you draw some conclusions about the
universe based on that study. You’re trying+} to [-how people use concepts, rather than-] {+impart that Knowledge+}
to [-how they think about
them. Therefore, by offering-] {+someone else along with+} the [-methods of philosophy without philosophical jargon,

174-] {+supporting Data and Information. We

would say Data but it’s really Information, because measurements were
taken and+} we [-can understand how the participant understands certain concepts without spending
significant time teaching philosophy’s vocabulary.

Asking philosophical questions of non-philosophers is mostly a pointless exercise.

Specifically, asking philosophical questions worded-] {+use them+} in [-philosophical jargon-] {+some way and that+} is [-pointless. The
intent of the SDFN-] {+Information from which
we derive some Knowledge which hopefully+} is [-to remove the intimidating-] {+self-evident+} and [-almost-taboo jargon from deep
questions of philosophy.

By allowing people-] {+we’re
trying+} to [-approach the problem laterally, through categorization
rather than definition, interviewers can inspect the evidence of the understanding without requiring participants-] {+impart that+} to [-directly articulate their practical definitions. By focusing
the categorization in-] {+people.

Interviewer: This Knowledge is+} a [-domain where the participant-] {+change in prediction modes,+} is a [-subject-matter expert, the
participant feels confident and-]
{+change+} in [-control while meaning-] {+context, both?
Participant: Both.

Interviewer: So Information can cause changes in Knowledge, or+} is [-generated.

The SDFN interview methodology is not only useful for experimental philosophers
performing interviews. It is extendable into focus groups and Joint Application Design
(JAD) sessions. The DFD methodology has been used successfully to diagram consensus
in-] a [-focus group.

Consensus building through DFD construction requires that all members of the
focus group be considered “subject-matter experts”-]
{+change+} in [-the topic of the universe of discourse. As the transforms are created, people-] {+Knowledge?
Participant: It can cause changes+} in [-the group discover places where their
understanding-] {+Knowledge. It could always be
rejected or it could be wrong.

Interviewer: We’ve got Knowledge filters Data, produces Information,
produces Knowledge. Are there any other metarelationships here?
Participant: I think we’ve had enough
Interviewer: Nonsense, I’m only mostly confused.

Participant: ???
Interviewer: What kind+} of [-reality is not reciprocated across the group, and argument erupts. This
argument serves to generate-] {+Knowledge does Information cause+} a [-local trading zone if necessary or, more to the point, forces
people-] {+change
in?
Participant: I’m taking change+} to [-clarify their arguments and generally refine their statements.

The SDFN offers a-] {+include simply: we’ve increased our
Knowledge. So, all Information increases my contextual Knowledge.

??? If it’s+} more [-streamlined approach-] {+Information about something I already had Knowledge
about it will either reinforce or cause me+} to [-knowledge discovery than the DFD
does. The modern use-] {+do stuff: well, I’ve got 2
pieces+} of {+Information in conflict, it means+} the [-DFD’s focus-] {+Knowledge worker+} is
{+trying+} to [-translate business practices into technological systems. Although-] {+resolve that conflict so that+} this [-usage is an excellent basis for collaborative and participatory
software design, it is difficult to adopt fully when looking-] {+bit might get weaker in this
area.

Interviewer: When people you communicate with disagree with you,
do they diverge from this?
Participant: Sometimes yes.

Interviewer: Lets look+} at [-more theoretical matters.


175-] {+both cases. When they diverge from this,
where is their point of departure?
Participant:+} The [-DFD’s focus on data, transformations, and atemporailty * means-] {+annoying case is: you’re wrong, I don’t have any evidence but I know you’re wrong.

Interviewer: What does+} that [-explicit definitions-] {+annoying case stem from?
Participant: Some past politics. A lot+} of {+problems just aren’t really
clear cut. Because you have a limited understanding, a limited+} data [-fields and their transformations are required. Such explicit definitions can
be useful, but they can also serve as-] {+set
about+} a [-major obstacle, taking valuable interviewing time-] {+thing, you can’t always... well I’ve developed a model about its

is great... "Yeah, you didn’t consider what happened in 2002" yeah, I
didn’t put that+} in the [-focus group-] {+Data set, I didn’t think it was important. "Yeah, it
is." I look+} and [-the JAD.

By indicating how different stakeholders categorize flows,-] {+go: "Actually+} it [-can identify specific points
of departure without getting bogged down-] {+is important." So my contextual filter was
incomplete. So they provided me with new Knowledge or Knowledge
that was new to me, which I then have to adjust my contextual filter,
and+} in [-excruciatingly exact definitions-] {+light+} of {+that,+} the {+Knowledge coming from my study of my+} data
[-structures needed to successfully program an application. Most people do-]
{+points may+} not [-naturally
think in the required fractal decompositions of-] {+be correct.

Interviewer: Where do "shoulds" fall here? Either incoming or outgoing?
Participant: Should should be an outcome.

Interviewer: Specifically, if you’re producing normative assertions,
what are they here?
Participant: For me, I would say that they’re Knowledge. For+} the [-DFD, and arguing about-] {+recipient they’re probably Information.

Interviewer: When you are+} the [-level on
which a particular transformation belongs is another significant distraction. Arguments
in focus groups tend-] {+recipient of normative recipient of
normative assertions, you consider them to be?
Participant: I consider them+} to be [-definitional, articulating the nature of a transform or a flow.

Looking at entities and their categorizations, rather than focusing on the necessary-] {+Information. I don’t trust other
people. When someone says you should do blank, you should go+} and
[-tedious-to-define elements needed-]
{+measure this. Well, OK, but I have+} to [-create a working software specification, can direct
the focus group’s focus towards philosophical challenges rather than implementation.

When presenting-] {+decide myself if I’m going to
actually believe you.

Interviewer: So these are untrusted assertions?
Participant: Until I do some vetting, everyone’s assertions are untrusted.

Interviewer: And+} an [-SDFN in a group environment, it-] {+untrusted assertion+} is [-better to use-] {+Information? Is+} it [-as a brain-

storming document rather than as a definitional document *. Thus, as groups disagree,
the disagreements can be noted and saved for later. Batching-] {+different
from+} the [-areas of disagreement,
both in a small group and with-] {+Information from+} the [-many stakeholders-] {+study+} of [-a JAD, means that patterns-] {+problem at hand?
Participant: It+} can
[-emerge as part of the exercise, and-] {+be Information that’s coming from+} the [-focus can-] {+outside, yeah.

While studying there will+} be [-kept on abstract meaning-making.

The SDFN, when presented-] {+other stakeholders who will tell you stuff.

If they’re powerful, you have+} to [-a focus group, is a method for modeling the presence and
absence-] {+at least pay lip service to them.

Interviewer: How do you vet these pieces+} of [-flows and their nature via categorization, rather than-] {+Information?
Participant: Who do you trust? If it’s somebody who I respect technically, then I will take+} their [-specific qualities
and manipulations.

Although the SDFN-] {+advice. If it’s someone who I think+} is [-useful in focus groups for academic research, it-] {+a <bad
person> then, unless what they’ve said+} is [-also very
useful in the IT discipline. One of-] {+obviously true by inspection,
then it gets far more weighting down. If+} the [-largest areas of difficulty that IT faces-] {+person+} is {+really powerful
it’s no longer about trust. If someone really powerful+} in [-trying

to map-] an [-organization’s specific reality-] {+open forum
tells me+} to [-a computer program. To make correct recommendations-] {+do something, I ignore that at my peril. It’s+} about [-which programs to use, which customizations are necessary, and
which new interfaces and databases to correct, a new IT project must model-] {+weighing
up+} the [-“reality”
*

Maier explored how-] {+Information that’s come+} to [-get groups-] {+me. Do I have+} to [-problem solve optimally and found that focusing-] {+act on that? That
will depend+} on [-defining the
problem reduced fighting due to no-one getting too attached to early sub-optimal solutions [76].


or understanding that-] the [-final users have of how their business operates. This entirely
subjective experience, facilitating and instantiating something found only in the minds
of-] {+original relationships?
Interviewer: Where does meta-data fall here?
Participant: Sometimes it’s Information. You didn’t want that answer.

The Data about Data.


Interviewer: In this flow, what is+} the [-members-] {+meta-data? Is there any? Is it
flowing past?
Participant: It’s part+} of [-an organization, requires careful exploration during-] the [-investigation
phase.

The SDFN, like other IT tools, offers a way of modeling-] {+filter, yeah. To get+} the [-customer’s understanding-] {+specific example+} of [-the business reality.-]
{+those noun 74 tapings, they measure noun 74. What noun 74 do they
measure?+} The [-process of categorization can be applied to more unusual
aspects of meaning-making than operational definitions of data. Categories can reflect
urgency, importance, relevancy, difficulty, or even utility. These categories are a way
of both operationalizing-] {+meta-data is how+} the [-terms-] {+measurement is actually taken.

Interviewer:+} and [-evoking a deeper understanding of the reality-] {+so+} that [-they model within their consciousness. For example, asking participants to categorize flows with respect to difficulty will generate diagrams reflecting their subjective
perceptions of difficulty, and therefore areas upon which to focus IT expertise.

As-] {+meta-data can be+} a [-technique, the SDFN-] {+???+} is [-quite suited to finding holes-] {+Data itself, is Information, is Knowledge?
Participant: It’s Information+} in [-communication. In
a large study, multiple interviews would be necessary to help every participant-] {+the main. I make the distinction+} in [-an
organization create an SDFN covering all of their important business activities. Then,-] {+that
case so+} when {+we’re discussing+} the [-researchers compare entity diagrams and the relationships among them, topic
areas diagrammed by various people will not only identify communicative silos (by
revealing where few links between entities exist), but may also identify completely
different understandings-] {+meta-data+} of those [-areas. In this sense, the requirement that every variable
be completely and objectively defined is a poor fit for finding these areas of operational
difference.


The SDFN presents far less temptation to represent the “reality as it should be.” *

*

When creating-] {+noun 74 tapings,
there’s+} a [-database design-] {+pipe+} with {+X cells and has+} a [-DFD, the designer’s first task is to model-] {+hole in each cell. But+} the [-“current reality.”
When that model is completed,-] {+pipe... we
have one Noun 4 at+} the [-“current DFD” is considered and “streamlined” to represent a future
reality-] {+end. I’ve told+} with the [-database within it. It is far too tempting to skip to-] {+other dimensions: you
know how many holes there are, you know where they are, you know
what+} the [-“reality as it should be” step without
modeling-] {+separation is. That’s all informing you about+} the [-client’s current reality.


The data-definition aspects of-] {+measurement
I’m making at+} the [-DFD present an urge to operationalize to a consistent
definition. All flows-] {+end+} of [-type X are operationalized as X and therefore the differences in
understanding and opinion between the different participants are mostly eliminated
through-] the [-conscious or unconscious use-] {+pipe which is my original piece+} of [-the same or similar data dictionaries (which
are themselves biasing towards-] {+Data. So
I’ve given you+} a [-technical view-] {+bunch+} of [-things.)
The SDFN is an excellent tool for IT because, although it is suggestive of the DFD, it
does not have the software legacy that-] {+Data about+} the [-DFD has-] {+meta-data+} and {+you have some
Information which+} is [-ideally suited towards discovering the meaning that individuals attach to entities and to-] {+maybe "this isn’t reliable" or maybe its something
measuring this thing or+} the [-relationships between
them.

The-] other [-advantage of the SDFN as a meaning-making technique in IT is-] {+thing.

Interviewer: Is Data atomic?
Participant: In this example, we pretend+} that [-it is
far more approachable, both as a participant and as an interviewer. The DFD has strict
requirements for atemporality and acausality, which present considerable difficulties-] {+Data is. Because+} in [-intuitive rendering. As it is forbidden to note that one transformation happens “before” another transformation (because function design-] {+every
case leaving out quantum mechanics, these are continuous variables.

But we noun 37 them at discrete points+} in [-structured language is itself
atemporal with respect to incoming-] {+time+} and [-outgoing data flows), the act-] {+space. So we treat
them in all analysis pretty much as discrete observations.

Interviewer: So there are no sub components+} of [-transforming
the usually causal account into-] {+observations? You
can’t have half an observation?
Participant: That’s true. We would like to think... it’s+} a [-DFD distances the diagram from-] {+thing.

Interviewer: Is there anything past Knowledge?
Participant: An overall Knowledge framework?
Interviewer: Is this overall Knowledge framework Knowledge?
Participant: I consider+} the [-participant’s reality.

This distancing, as noted before,-] {+whole thing+} is [-less useful when trying to understand the participant’s reality and especially less useful when trying to model interactions of people in a
company.


8.1.2 The SDFN and X-Phi
The SDFN-] {+Knowledge. We’re just growing. I think Knowledge+} is [-an excellent way of probing definitions-] {+just the boundary.

Interviewer: Is Information divisible?
Participant: Yes. A piece+} of [-philosophical understanding. It-] {+Information, if I take the noun 74 difference between two things+} is {+foo, that’s+} a [-useful tool-] {+piece+} of [-X-Phi, which, as Sosa notes [77]:
... bears on traditional philosophy in at least-] {+Information about
the system, versus the difference between+} two [-ways. It puts in question what-] {+things+} is {+immediately
decomposable to two things.

Interviewer: Is there cases where it’s atomic,+} or is [-not believed intuitively by people generally. Moreover,-] it [-challenges the truth of beliefs that are generally held, ones tradi-

tionally important in philosophy. Each challenge is based-] {+always divisible
into Data?
Participant: It could be atomic. It depends+} on [-certain
experimental results.


The SDFN is-] {+what it’s Information
about.

Interviewer: Give me+} a [-way-] {+case where we have a piece of atomic Information.

Participant: The diameter+} of [-generating experimental results. Specifically, by having all
participants in-] the [-interview explore-] {+pipe on+} the [-same topic-] {+drawing.


Interviewer: The diameter+} of the [-SDFN, it is possible to render
all diagrams commensurate.

The SDFN is a tool for probing practical understanding. Most current methodologies
depend-] {+pipe+} on [-scenarios and multiple choice questions to probe “what would you do?” Although-] the [-scenario-based survey questions are excellent at testing approaches to moral
questions, by their very nature, they do-] {+drawing is Information+}
not [-allow for inventive answers. In many ways,-] {+Data, because...

Participant: If it was a measurement of+} the [-SDFN and its categorizations-] {+actual pipe it+} would be [-ideal complements to the survey, by allowing
people to differentiate various types of moral action and to engage in what amounts to a
structured role-play.

At the same time, the split between practical and theoretical definitions in moral
philosophy-] {+Data.

But this is Information. It+} may [-produce unusually large cognitive dissonance in participants, decreasing
the accuracy of the technique. Although assessing the philosophy of data-] {+not be correct. This+} is [-tricky, there
are no overriding imperatives to present-] a [-“socially accepted” behavior towards data.

Due to-] {+drawing, it’s not+}
the [-lack of-] {+actual thing. It’s+} a [-moral dimension, there are few socially approved “right answers”
that would impede-] {+thing about the thing. It’s not meta-data.

Interviewer: It’s+} a [-participant’s true views of-] {+thing about+} the [-topic. Hewing-] {+thing that’s not meta-data. Is Knowledge atomic?
Participant: If I could only point+} to [-the party line is
important-] {+something and say... we do do that
and point+} to {+something and say "That’s Knowledge." except that that’s
not – it depends on+} the [-participant, but-] {+context we said that in.

Interviewer: Can we point at something and go that’s Knowledge?
Participant: Not realistically.

Interviewer: When we point at something and go that’s Knowledge,
what are we pointing at?
Participant: In+} the [-articulation-] {+abstract sense?
Interviewer: What category+} of [-the organization’s policy-] {+thing+} is [-sufficient
to demonstrate their own philosophies of data: they interpret the organization’s desires
through their own mental framework, producing answers-] {+it+} that [-sound right to themselves.

To take advantage of the nature of flows in-] {+we are pointing at? I
point at+} this [-instance, a potential experimental
dynamic would be to categorize flows as “the right thing to do, the wrong-] {+and go this is Knowledge. When I point at this and go this
is Knowledge. Is this Knowledge? Is this Information? is this Data?
Participant: The physical+} thing [-to do,
or neutral.” Specifically,-] {+that you’re pointing at is+} the [-interviewer would have a set-] {+physical
representation+} of [-two- to three-sentence

scenarios befalling-] {+the Knowledge that hopefully both you and I hold in
our heads.

Interviewer: So it’s+} a [-group-] {+Knowledge representation that’s not necessarily
Knowledge, Information, nor Data? Representations+} of [-related entities. Participants would then build the SDFN
from-] {+these categories
do not necessarily require that+} the [-scenario, gradually categorizing flows between people.


8.1.3 The SDFN’s role-] {+representation itself be+} in [-business modeling
The SDFN is an excellent tool-] {+that category.

Participant: I agree.

Interviewer: Is there a category+} for [-business modeling. Just as Information Technologists
need-] {+representations?
Participant: Yeah, meta-data.

Interviewer: When you try+} to [-understand a business-] {+communicate these representations+} to [-create devices-]
{+people+} and [-software for it, consultants-] {+an error occurs, where are those errors, what are those
errors,+} and
[-managers need to-] {+why?
Participant: The errors can+} be [-able to know not only the logistical nature-] {+my communication+} of [-their business, but-] {+that. Faulty analogy, assumptions about recipient, that kind of thing. There’s+} also {+reception errors where+} the [-subjective-] {+person doesn’t listen+} or [-practical structure. The SDFN-] is [-one way-] {+missing something
that would help them that they require+} to [-model the structure of
an organization.-] {+receive that Knowledge.

Interviewer: Errors can apply on either side.+} The [-SDFN, if all participants engage,-] {+noun 97 of communication+} is [-a way to derive-] {+what? Errors occurs on+} the [-actual structure-] {+sending side+} of [-an
organization organically. Depending on management philosophy, be it coordinative or
authoritarian, people will identify communications from those who are their managers-] {+misreading of
what?
Participant: Faulty assumptions, deficiencies+} in [-practice, without regard to the organization chart. By creating an SDFN with categories
that-] {+transmission.

Interviewer: So these transmissions+} are [-types-] {+all representations+} of [-business communication, it should be possible-] {+these
three categories?

Participant: If we’re talking about transferring Knowledge+} to [-identify small groups,
the communication hubs, and the actual functions each group performs.

Most formal charts apply-] {+someone
else, it’s all+} a [-template-] {+representation.

Interviewer: In transferring Knowledge+} to [-reality. They assert that because-] someone
[-has-] {+else,+} the [-title-] {+sender
can have errors+} of [-“director,” that word indeed describes what he-] {+assumptions+} or [-she is and should be
doing [78]. The nominal method-] of [-business organizations is-] {+representation. Can you transfer
Information+} to {+someone else?
Participant: Yes, that’s what we defined in those examples.

Interviewer: Sending Errors there are what?
Participant: Straight out mistakes. Transcription errors.

Interviewer: Sending Errors in Data?
Participant: Transmission errors or corruption
Interviewer: Reception errors of Data are?
Participant: They just didn’t listen. That would+} apply [-pressure to make
reality conform-] to [-organizational charts. With the current rate at which demands on business-] {+all categories.

Interviewer: Intentional deafness? What other errors+} are [-increasing, businesses cannot be that inflexible. This problem is compounded
with more sophisticated management schemes, which make it even more difficult to
model the reality of a corporation versus its actual practices. Data mining tools only go so
far and do not actually track the most vital elements of management: communications.

The SDFN can become a tool for-] {+there receiving?
Participant:+} understanding [-what people do in an organization.

It is vital-] {+errors. They got all+} that {+was transmitted
but their own contextual filter rejected+} it [-cannot be used in any kind-] {+or parts+} of [-coercive setup, because-] {+it.

Interviewer: Contextual filter errors.


7.5 Interview 5
Interviewer: What would you say – can you differentiate into projects?
Or has+} it [-depends on

people honestly self-reporting and actively engaging with the interviewer. However, by
having interviewers spend time with people and asking them to model the entities-] {+just been one stream+} of
[-an organization, the SFDN will not only demonstrate their philosophies-] {+continuous research.

Participant: The parts+} of [-organization,
but will show where cognitive splits are occurring and where one group thinks it is
communicating one thing but a different group is hearing something else.

This technique might be extremely valuable to-] the [-academic side of business, because it-] {+noun 118+} can [-allow academicians-] {+be broken up+} to [-explore the utility-] {+some degree.

So a lot+} of [-various management practices
and to identify their consequent effects in an organization. Looking-] {+time has been spent looking+} at {+how to put+} the [-patterns-] {+materiel into
top+} of [-communications from all entities,-] the [-SDFN might be-] {+noun 118. How you feed+} a [-tool to supplement standard
models of technological adoption.

When modeling different perceptions of-] {+noun 118. ... And+} the [-organization,-] {+bottom
of+} the [-SDFN makes no attempt to be objective. In fact,-] {+noun 118,+} the [-lack-] {+hearth, ... there’s a lot+} of [-objectivity-] {+work that happens on
that. Because that+} is the [-very essence of the methodology’s utility. By explicitly modeling, one can identify how the logical constructs-] {+blackest+} of {+black boxes for+} the
[-organization diverge. Noting how management understands business reality-] {+noun 118. What
happens there. Stuff goes in, stuff goes out,+} and [-how
programmers understand-] {+you can measure Noun
12s around+} the [-same reality makes-] {+side. And that’s it. And you cannot probe it. You just
see+} it [-possible to create-] {+once every 20 years.

Interviewer: Because that’s when you flush it out?
Participant: That’s right. That’s when you do+} a [-more reflective
and accurate model of-] {+reline. And even there,+}
the [-organization.

The model reflects that different people have different areas-] {+mere act+} of [-expertise. Combining the synthetic, subjective, and individual viewpoints where they match and creating-] {+cooling it off completely changes+} what [-amounts to an organizational SDFN, with every SDFN mapped into one large document, will allow patterns with identified sub-groupings to emerge, as people detail the
areas-] {+you can look at.

It’s vaguely representative+} of [-their expertise.

At the same time,-] {+what was happening.

Interviewer: So+} the [-SDFN is-] {+... experiments ...

Participant: when they verb 119ed+} a [-way of identifying organizational silos: areas where
there should logically be communications of vital information but, for one reason or
another, the communication does-] {+noun 118 and cut it in half basically.

Interviewer: Doesn’t really model...

Participant: Even that. You’ll get Information out, but it’s still+} not [-occur. By identifying strongly connected groups
talking about the same self-categorized entities without links between them, organiza-

tions can improve communications.

It is also a means by which individual departments can advocate-]
{+perfect Information. It’s pretty cool, but it’s not perfect.

an organization. By identifying how they are viewed internally and externally, departments and individuals can identify problems caused-] {+Interview 5

Interviewer: When you say we get Information out, This is what I’m
looking at. What do you mean+} by [-a lack of trading zones. The lack
of border regions can,-] {+Information?
Participant: You can dig down,+} in [-part, then be rectified by intentional planning once the problem
has been identified.

This methodology may be able to expose the flows of data within-] a [-government
organization, producing a map of practical reality and-] {+controlled way. You can excavate+}
the [-functioning-] {+noun 118, taking noun 37+} of [-government
departments. Doing so would require an enormous scope-] {+materials+} and [-appropriate security clearances, but the identification of data flows could even help to identify redundant activities
between remote departments. Identifying this redundancy may not convince either department to reduce its activities, but it may-] {+analyze their chemistry

or their micro-structure or their metallurgy or something like that.

And you’ll be looking+} at [-least improve accuracy by giving each
department someone with whom to compare results. At-] the [-same time, it may-] {+physical shapes of what’s where. ... Plus+}
also
[-identify communicative silos in departments and suggest useful-] {+their micro-structure+} and [-practical lines of
communication out of those silos.

The process of organization modeling-] {+things like that. So, as you go down+}
through the [-SDFN focuses less on-] {+noun 118, you’re looking for zones: “What’s+} the [-exploration-] {+material
structure in each zone+} of [-definitions. Instead,-] the [-SDFN creates a data-focused graph of communications
within an organization, which can identify unlinked but mutual schools of thought, communications silos, and redundant activities. This is a way to expose-] {+noun 118.” Before things have melted, at+}
the [-undocumented
links-] {+zone things are melting, below+} that [-form the pragmatic reality of any organization.


8.1.4 Workflow Modeling and-] {+point. And you’re trying to
estimate what+} the [-SDFN
Beyond organizational modeling, computer-requirements modeling,-] {+physics+} or the [-academic
evocation-] {+chemistry was that’s happening when
the noun 118 was running at that point in space.

...

Interviewer: So, we start with a nice trivial flow. What is one+} of [-philosophical definitions,-] {+your
roles that you play in this project?
Participant: ... position 56, doing research experiments.

Interviewer: Are there other ... position 56s?
Participant: No.

Interviewer: So we can just call+} it [-is possible-] {+... position 56. At some point, you
either get a flow from somebody or send a flow+} to [-use the SDFN for the sociological

your most common person or thing+} of [-an organization. Although-] {+interaction?
Participant: Specific names, or are you looking for+} the [-organizational modeling focused on-] {+entities?
Interviewer: I’m+} looking

[-183

at communicative hierarchies, workflow modeling seeks-] {+for the roles. If names help you think, feel free+}
to [-understand-] {+use them. I edit them out during+} the [-communicative flows among people, objects, and other sources of data as a way of increasing-] {+transcription.

Participant: During+} the
[-efficiency of an organization. The simplicity of-] {+experimental stage, it was+} the [-SDFN allows people-] {+position 127. ...

Interviewer: Do you send stuff+} to [-describe their
workflows in roughly their own terminology. The advantages-] {+him or does he send stuff to you?
Participant: Both ways.

Interviewer: Let’s model one+} of [-increased comprehension outweigh-] the [-disadvantage of decreased precision: it is better-] {+things that you send+} to [-get more takes on
an organization’s workflow then-] {+him. I’m
using stuff here so I’m not going+} to [-get detailed but partially correct models from a few
experts.

The SDFN used-] {+prejudice you+} in [-workflow modeling is an excellent tool for any consulting group,
because it provides an interview technique that allows participants to walk the interviewers through their work without revealing the “deep secrets” of their work. One-] {+terms+} of [-the
most difficult obstacles in most consulting jobs is the sense that participants have that
the interviewer is trying-] {+... what
we’re going+} to [-take away their jobs [79 and 80]. Stressing that this methodology-] {+be doing+} is [-looking at interpersonal relations to improve communication and treating the
participant as-] {+we draw+} a [-subject matter expert empowers-] {+flow like this, we label+} the [-participant and could subsequently
make them more cooperative-] {+flow+}
with the [-technique.

For purposes of workflow modeling, the categorization methods will change. It is
important to note that this methodology must explore the flows between both devices
and people, not just the organizational model-] {+topic+} of [-people. And, that-] the [-flows are “work
units” rather than any communication. Work units are functionally a description of
incoming and outgoing artifacts of work processes, reports, orders,-] {+flow,+} and [-discussions to
support the creation of those orders, among other things. Therefore,-] {+then we label+} the [-SDFN will take
on more aspects-] {+flow with category+} of
the [-DFD and look at how entities pass and transform data between
them. The various jobs-] {+flow. Whether it’s Data, Information,+} or [-transformations should form the basis of categorization, rather
than philosophical definitions.

Even-] {+Knowledge. And+} if [-two people have many different flows connecting them,-] {+you say
other, we go into depth with what you mean, and what+} the [-workflow-] {+category
implies. And I’ll keep asking you this question until we’re done. There’s
no temporal+} model

[-184

should be able to distinguish, based on the self-assigned categories,-] {+here, everything just happens at+} the [-nature of different
jobs. Therefore,-] {+same time.

Because dealing+} with [-the identification of different jobs between various entities, the
SDFN-] {+temporality+} is [-a tool to answer the difficult question-] {+just... too much+} of [-“What is it, exactly, that-] {+a pain. We have
a flow from+} you {+... What+} do [-here?”

without relying on the usually unhelpful “job title.”

8.1.5 Design consulting uses for the SDFN
The SDFN is also a tool for software designers outside the bounds of the normal IT academic uses. Although it can serve as an excellent check on-] {+you send him?
Participant: During+} the [-validity of DFD and state
transition diagrams,-] {+experiments, I’ll send him observations from+}
the [-process of defining terms through categorization serves as a way
to understand-] {+results.

Interviewer: Observations? Or+} what [-the clients are expressing as part of their data-flow diagrams and
identifications. The normal data-flow diagram requires participants-] {+shall we label this? Results?
Participant: I don’t send raw Data. I send interpreted Data. I won’t send
raw measurements+} to [-define elements
through iterative decomposition,-] {+him,+} but [-this process focuses less on specific definitions-] {+I’ll send an interpretation+} of
[-flows (which may well just-] {+those raw
measurements.

Interviewer: Let’s go interpretation of measurements. Is this flow Data,
Information, Knowledge, or other?

Participant: What would I call it? I’d+} be [-discarded) and more-] {+hazy+} on [-grouping those flows into categories representing-] the [-intuitions-] {+difference between
Information+} and [-realities of the client.

This technique is-] {+Knowledge. Can we define it, or do you have+} a [-way to reconcile differences-] {+better
definition+} in {+your head?
Interviewer: Here’s+} the [-DFD and other modeling
techniques when the created models come from different people. The differences are
expressed as categories, and-] {+thing. If there isn’t a difference,+} then {+there
isn’t a difference. I’m putting+} the [-people who showed the differences-] {+terms out there. You+} can [-be interviewed through this technique.

The SDFN is also a way-] {+use them
as complete synonyms if you wish. Or you can differentiate them. I’m
trying+} to [-generate a rough-] model [-of-] {+what’s in your head. Unfortunately I’ve got difficulty
putting probes in.

Participant: It’s a black box. I’d probably call it Information then. And
I’d call it that because it’s not just raw numbers. I’d plot+} an [-organization. This model is-] {+interpretation to it by some means. But it’s not Knowledge because it’s the
experiment. And it’s+} a
[-handy side benefit beyond-] {+very contrived environment that it’s coming out
of, so it’s interpreted Data about this contrived environment. Saying
when we do this on+} the [-categorization, such-] {+experimental rig, we see this effect happening.

And I’ll often leave it fairly plain like+} that [-detailed diagramming techniques
can be employed at interesting junctures. The model-] {+for them because I’m not
familiar enough with their day to day observations+} of [-data flows must model-] the
[-organization’s practical realities, representing how data and information pass between
entities. From an IT standpoint, all organizations are simple information processors: they
transform certain inputs into certain outputs. This process may cause a delivery or matter

185-] {+noun 118+}
to [-exchange hands, but it-] {+know if this+} is [-either outside the scope-] {+a relict observation+} of [-the business-] {+our experimental rig+} or [-is represented
as an information exchange. Thus, as-] {+if it’s
really+} a [-way-] {+phenomenon+} of [-quickly modeling what different people
consider to be the data exchange within an organization,-] the [-SDFN is an excellent way-] {+noun 118. It’s not Knowledge yet. We don’t
want them+} to
[-map-] {+do something at+} the [-data flows of an organization, and thereby get an idea for how it functions.

The rough mapping of an organization for purposes of design means-] {+noun 118 based on+} that {+yet.

Interviewer: what does+} the [-system
design can focus-] {+position 127 do with this flow?
Participant: What they have done, in the past, considered it. Often it
will be verbal or written. They’ll consider it, and then they’ll tell me
whether it’s consistent with something they observe+} on the [-practical-] {+noun 118.

Interviewer: How would we label that flow back to you?
Participant: Again, I think it would be Information, because we both
realize, me+} and [-real problems of-] the [-organization as discovered,
rather than on-] {+noun 118 position 58 realize we’re not talking about+}
the [-problems-] {+same things. I’ve got a model+} as [-articulated at the start. This mapping can be accomplished
through what amounts to-] a [-random sampling of-] {+chemical noun 120, and so we’re
talking about observations that we’re making and+} an [-organization without any-] {+interpretation+}
of [-the
categorization aspects. Once a rough communications map is generated, more focus can
be applied-] {+what we’re seeing, and we’re looking+} to [-“interesting” areas: areas that diverge on many maps or areas that are
flagged during interviews as-] {+see if there’s+} a [-problem by many people.

More vitally,-] {+correlation
between+} the [-SDFN-] {+two.

Interviewer: And so this Information flow back to you. What topic+} is
{+it? He’s transforming your interpretation of measurements how?
Participant: I’ll give+} a [-useful tool for user experience designers. It is-] {+comment about+} a [-way of
exploring semantic expectations. Users would be able to create an SDFN of applications
they currently use and categorize different interaction methodologies within the purview
of the user’s current understanding of software systems. Beyond that, by describing
entities within-] {+specific phenomenon that I see.

Let’s say it’s+} a [-software system, it is-] {+variation with flow rate and time. And I’ll see, under+} a [-tool for reconciling the needs-] {+set+}
of {+circumstances at+} a [-group of users
and helping them to jointly articulate-] {+particular point. And that’s+} what [-they want from an application using the
same language.

Because the SDFN evokes the definitions of items through the process of categorization,-] I [-believe it is able to build trading zones by making participants aware of their own-] {+tell him+} and [-others’ evaluative accents. By applying the SDFN across-]
{+he’ll come back and may say: “that’s interesting, but we have situation
x,y,z. We see+} a [-group-] {+similar effect.”
Interviewer: So we would say that’s correlation with noun 120?
Participant: He’ll tell me if my Information correlates or doesn’t.

Interviewer: So really, it’s a confirmation+} of [-users’ expectations-] {+correlation. And you would
say that that confirmation of correlation Information because+} of [-the same planned software environment,-] it [-may be possible-]
{+interpreted but not situated?
Participant: It’s interpreted, but it’s not immediately relevant+} to [-learn each user’s
distinct categories and terms for entities and data within-] {+the
noun 118. We’re not going to change anything. We’re not going to

change what we do at the noun 118 based on+} that [-environment. Using those
terms where appropriate and explicitly highlighting possible misunderstandings-] {+yet. It+} may
[-create-] {+change
what I do with my experiment.

Interviewer: Let’s look at that. He sends back+} a [-language among all potential users of the software.


Analyzing user experience, this methodology can diagram the nature-] {+confirmation+} of {+correlation, whether or not it’s positive or negative confirmation, he’s giving
you something back. Then, what do you do?
Participant: It depends on where+} the [-normal
inputs-] {+experiments are going,+} and [-articulate the differences beyond simple data-driven definitions such as “field,
14 characters long.” The level of detail that a DFD requires-] {+how
critical it+} is [-far beyond-] {+with these experiments. Often I’ll say, “That’s interesting”
but I’m going to keep going with my experimental plan because we’re
only partway through or it was a side issue that’s not an immediate
concern.

Interviewer: Is your experiment an entity here?
Participant: Yeah, I guess it would. If I dropped dead, I would hope+} that [-needed for
most enterprise models. However,-]
{+somebody would keep going with+} the [-DFD fails-] {+experiment. The experimental
plan doesn’t depend on me.

Interviewer: Do you send Data, Information, or Knowledge+} to [-function if-] the [-most trivial of flows is
not precisely defined, because its philosophical basis of functional decomposition breaks
down. Changing-] {+experiment?
Participant: I don’t. I build+} the [-perspective-] {+experiment.

Interviewer: You send a flow+} of [-the diagram from objective reality to subjective user’s
viewpoint removes the requirement for precisely specified data flows.

By allowing designers-] {+Data+} to [-explore-] the [-expected inputs-] {+experiment+} and [-outputs of the system from-] {+what would
you classify this Data flow as?
Participant: It’s Data. I’m specifying+} the [-perspective of-] {+equipment geometry,+} the [-users, it becomes possible-]
{+operational set points.

Interviewer: So you’re sending specifications+} to [-build more sophisticated information
architectures and user experiences tailored for-] the [-needs and expectations of those users.


8.2 Uses of-] {+experiment... Do
you send anything else to+} the [-Philosophy of Data-] {+experiment?
Participant:+} The [-philosophy of data as presented in this research-] {+experiment itself+} is [-an intensely pragmatic philosophy.

The exploration of real peoples’ philosophies of data has little utility on its own, and
derives most of its power from providing-] {+not+} a [-means of exploring someone’s internal reality
as-] {+conscious entity. So I don’t
think I could send anything else to it, I could only send+} it [-relates-] {+Data.

Interviewer: Does the experiment send anything+} to [-data.

Therefore,-] {+you?
Participant: Data.

Interviewer: It sends you Data.

Participant: I get numbers back from this.

Interviewer: Do we want to call that numbers or do we want to call that
something else?
Participant: Data. I’ll get.

Interviewer: Sorry, the flow, the label+} for the [-philosophy of data to be of value,-] {+flow. It’s Data, but what
topic is it? Is+} it [-must be used. There are uses
for-] {+just numbers, is it results, or is it...

Participant: I’ll get numbers from+} the [-philosophy-] {+various instruments we have, be
they cameras or weights versus time, that sort+} of {+stuff.

Interviewer: So you send a+} data [-both in the business and academic worlds, outside-] {+flow to+} the [-study-] {+experiment+} of
[-the philosophy as philosophy.-] {+specifications.+}
The [-philosophy of data can be used as-] {+experiment sends you+} a [-unique consulting
lens,-] {+data flow of numbers back. Then what
happens? What other interactions do we have with these two entities?
Participant: We’ll also,+} for [-looking at-] {+this particular project, we’ll also have position 122s. Who are noun 95ing new equipment.


Interviewer: What interactions are they having?
Participant: For there we’re, it’s a stronger influence than+} the [-client’s requirements in such-] {+Position
22’s. I’m actually wanting to give them Knowledge.

Interviewer: So you send them+} a [-way-] {+flow of Knowledge or do you send
them a flow of something else+} that [-their data realities are
weighted most heavily. Besides-] {+they take...

Participant: They will get+} the [-sheer novelty of-] {+same information as the Position 22.

Interviewer: So they get that flow?
Participant: They get that flow. They also get a flow from me about “I
think you should do this.”
Interviewer: And you asserting: “I think you should do this?” is? Let’s
first go: how do we label that?
Participant: I’ve done+} this [-approach,-] {+experiment, I’ve asked the Position 22 and+} it [-may offer unique
insights into clients’ problems.

The reason for-]
{+correlates with noun 118 performance, therefore I think+} the [-creation-] {+new noun
95 should have these features.

Interviewer: Can we summarize that?
Participant: I’d say that’s Knowledge.

Interviewer: That’s Knowledge. Can we have a 2-3 word description+} of
{+this Knowledge that’s not that sentence?
Participant: Equipment noun 95 recommendation.

Interviewer: So you send+} the [-philosophy-] {+position 122s your interpretation+} of [-data, however, was to improve
database-] {+measurements+} and [-user-interface design. There is-] {+you send them+} a [-clear need to understand clients’ philoso-

phies-] {+Knowledge flow+} of [-data when creating systems for them, and as such, the philosophy-] {+equipment noun 95
recommendations. Do you send them anything else?
Participant: As part+} of [-data will
be very useful to designers.


8.2.1 Using-] the [-Philosophy-] {+Information flows to those, I may include a
little bit+} of {+raw Data, but not very much.

Interviewer: Does this raw+} Data [-in buisness efficiency consulting
The philosophy of data is primarily-] {+...

Participant: usually photos or+} a [-means for understanding how people think and
use-] {+graph.

Interviewer: So you would say that photos are raw+} data. [-In a consulting scenario,-]
{+Participant: Yes.

Interviewer: Would you say that+} the [-primary product-] {+raw data+} is [-transmitted understanding.

Consultants can employ this understanding in design,-] {+contained+} in [-reorganization, or as a way to
change lines-] {+the Information? i.e. you send them interpretation+} of [-communication within an organization. By looking at how different people within a team relate to their sources of data, they can reduce sources of inefficiency
and error in non-intuitive ways.-] {+measurements.+} As [-an X-Phi, the philosophy of data offers a novel take on a whole suite-] {+part+} of [-methodologies for understanding aspects-]
{+that interpretation you have to send them some+} of [-an organization-] {+the measurements+}
that are [-not normally considered, but-] {+really interesting. Would you say+} that [-profoundly affect day-to-day operations. The application of X-Phi protocols beyond
those proposed in this dissertation may provide insights into-] the [-group philosophy of
data within an organization, which may then be exported as suggestions for change to-] {+Data is inside+} the [-organization so-]
{+Information flow, and we can just label this as Information? Or would
you say+} that [-people who do-] {+it’s Information + Data?
Participant: I’d keep it inside the Information flow, because if it was
just raw Data. They could very easily reach what I think is the wrong
idea – misinterpret.

Interviewer: Therefore you’re+} not [-share that philosophy are made aware of it.

These protocols may expose philosophical disconnects in an organization. Disconnects
may predict communicative siloing, detrimental political maneuvering, or sources of
error.

The philosophy of data and X-Phi in general offer options similar-] {+going: “Here’s the Information, here’s
the Data.” you’re going “Here’s the Information, here’s some Data inside
the Information+} to [-those provided
by sociological-] {+back it up.”

Participant: Yeah, that’s right. But with just the raw numbers+} and [-anthropological explorations in companies. They offer novel tools
for describing, documenting,-] {+no
context, that’s Data.

Interviewer: You send them this Knowledge flow+} and [-then presenting-] {+this Information flow. Does+} the [-companies back to themselves.

The process-] {+position 22 send them anything? or are there any
interactions that way?
Participant: As far as I know, yes there were. Part+} of [-exploring an organization’s philosophy-] {+that was direct
transfer+} of [-data, as encoded-] {+people. They actually got some Position 22s+} into [-its
practices and machines, provides a novel framework for understanding an organization.

Using-] the [-philosophy-] {+noun
95 team.

Interviewer: Would you say that’s a flow+} of [-data is far more than-] {+Data, Information, Knowledge?
Participant: Knowledge.

Interviewer: So there’s+} a [-venue for the SDFN, as-] {+Knowledge flow, from+} the [-methodology

used does not determine-] {+position 22 to+} the [-focus-]
{+position 122s+} of [-the research. In this vein, although the SDFN can be
used as-] {+personal expertise?
Participant: Yes. Personal expertise and personnel, physically personnel. But personal expertise.

Interviewer: Personal expertise of Knowledge. Would you say that
personnel transfer is+} a [-methodology for many different inquiries, many different methodologies can
be used to probe an organization’s philosophy-] {+flow+} of [-data.

The survey methodology, with appropriate changes such-] {+Data, Information, Knowledge or other?
Should we model a personnel transfer+} as [-adapting the scenarios
to typical business concerns, provides an excellent way-] {+some sort+} of [-grasping how different aspects-] {+conceptual flow?
Participant: No, it’s a convenient way+} of [-an organization understand, and therefore use, data. By applying-] {+doing+} the [-survey first,
practitioners may be able to identify “interesting” areas within an organization-] {+Knowledge transfer.

Interviewer: So it’s basically sneakernet.

Participant: it’s better than just writing it down+} in [-which
to do more thorough interviews, or they may-] {+a book and+} just [-leave-]
{+posting+} the [-survey-] {+book and having them read the book. It’s much more convenient.

Interviewer: So personal expertise+} as {+Knowledge flow from+} the [-only tool for a
smaller-scoped investigation.

Understanding an organization’s philosophy of data is important because data is
vital-] {+position
127+} to [-organizations. The databases of an organization serve as its collective memory.

Individual entities, especially in a large organization, are functionally unable to operate
the many concerns-] the [-organization has without a database. By exploring how different
people understand-] {+position 122s... do+} the [-database, it may be possible-] {+position 122s send anything back+} to [-understand some of the actual
problems that stem from data anomolies and corruption within the organization.

ments at Stanford saw-]

Participant: Current noun 95+} and [-amateur cartoonist, sketched the frontispiece illustration. To the Accounting Department, the SPEAR Magnetic Detector

Interviewer: So you’ve got+} a [-substantial problem in water cooling and electrical feeding; to Electronics there were the delicate
strands-] {+flow+} of [-instrument wire,-] {+personal expertise+} and {+they return
current noun 95 and intent.

Participant: and I’ll say that’s Information as opposed to... because of+}
the [-powerful conduits to the solenoid.

This was-] {+intent side of it. It’s+} not [-a world-] {+just raw Data. Data I tend to think+} of [-vanishing technical assistants, like those artisanal helpers who wrapped wire for Maxwell, or assisted Rutherford in
counting scintillator flashes; this-] {+as just
numbers.

Interviewer: If it+} was [-a laboratory where the physicists

Participant: yes
Interviewer: But, because it’s current noun 95+} and [-Logic [64], frontispiece, page xxi.

were by-] {+Data is encapsulated as this one is?
Participant: Yes.


Interviewer: Would you say that there’s+} no [-means mere extras. Amid such a coordinated cacophony of
construction, physicists could be lampooned by likening them to bewildered scavengers, walking parks and beaches in-] {+Data, there’s just Information?
Participant: No, because+} the [-hopes of culling
a gold ring from-] {+intent is embodied in+} the [-discarded flip tops-] {+noun 95. But
you need to know it in case they’ve misunderstood an operation+} and [-bent nails. The humor of-]
the [-cartoon –-] {+Position 22 can correct, can feedback Knowledge,+} and [-the reality of physics, I would argue – resides in its
startling diversity in how the machine looked from the vantage points
of the various subcultures-] {+say no no no,
your noun 95 won’t meet that intent.

Interviewer: And that feedback+} of [-physics.


In many ways,-] {+Knowledge is+} the [-study-] {+personal expertise?
Participant: Yes, that’s right.

Interviewer: SO they send this Information flow+} of {+Here’s+} the [-philosophy of data-] {+Data +
Information around it which+} is [-attempting to do the same
thing, though to-] {+Data and Information, not just Information. Do you as position 56 get anything from+} the [-intangible database rather than-] {+position 122s?
Participant: Yes. I tend+} to {+get that same stream.+} the [-extremely obvious scientific
instrument. Questioning-] {+current noun 95
and intent. But not so openly. I’ll get it filtered through because+} the [-philosophies of data within an organization-]
{+noun 95+} is [-a way of
investigating how an organization understands, produces,-] {+much bigger than what I do. There’s much more+} and [-manipulates its critical
signs.

Providing an organization with a discussion of its philosophy of data essentially
creates a framework within the company-] {+there’s
things+} that [-allows for self-reflection. Moreover, this
self-reflection will seem to come from-] {+I don’t care about.

Interviewer: So therefore it’s+} a [-privileged and external source, bypassing many-] {+different flow because it’s filtered. Do
we just want to put filtered in front+} of
[-the feuds and filters-] {+this?
Participant: Yes. For example,+} in [-intra-company communications, thereby reducing any instinctive-] {+my project, I very rarely get electrical
Information. Because I was looking at material flows, not electrical
flows.

Interviewer: This flow of filtered current noun 95+} and [-historical antipathy to change by providing-] {+intent is... Information, Data, Knowledge, other?
Participant: Information. Information because it’s not+} a [-new way of thinking-] {+real thing yet.

It’s not Knowledge+} about [-daily tasks.

The external source repackaging the participant’s own contributions, especially when
stripped of identifying features, increases the sense of the new or alien, and allows people
in-] a [-corporation to come up-] {+real device. It’s still a hypothetical.

Interviewer: Do they interact+} with [-new reasons to accept-] {+your experiment?
Participant: Yes, I may change, just as+} the [-presentation rather than to
stick with their normal habits.


8.2.2 Design and-] {+Position 22 feeds back, I might
change+} the [-Philosophy of Data
The philosophy-] {+experiments because+} of [-data may also be an interesting way-] {+that, likewise from the position
122’s side. I have changed experiments because+} of [-thinking about usability engineering. It presents novel ways-] {+what they’ve said.

Interviewer: Is that just a function+} of [-both understanding usability elements and, more-] {+changing specifications or is there
another flow+} to {+your experiment based on their Information to you?
Participant: I’ve changed noun 95,+} the [-point, assessing the understanding someone has-] {+noun 95+} of [-an interface’s underlying functionality. In many ways, combining the idea-] {+my experiment.

Interviewer: Is there a noun 95 flow to your experiment?
Participant: I’d say that’s part+} of the [-philosophy-] {+specifications. The geometry+} of [-data with usability

engineering shifts the focus-] {+it.

Interviewer: So geometry is part+} of [-the engineering toward understanding the person’s relationship with data-] {+specifications+} and [-what affordances they ascribe-] {+all this is just
Data.

Participant: It’s just numbers and stuff. Based on that, I’ll say I need+} to [-the interface’s presentation of
data.

{+change dimension X by this or curvature Y by that.

Interviewer: Given this set+} of [-data is explored,-] {+4 entities, are there any other interactions?
Participant: We did have people building equipment. I don’t know if
you’ll want to include that.


Interviewer: Are there stuff flows with these position 123?
Participant: Sometimes+} it [-allows-] {+was much more convenient for+} the [-designer-] {+noun 95
team to talk+} to [-understand-] the [-interface-based trading zones of-] {+position 123 rather than me.

Interviewer: SO+} the [-group. The nature of data is strongly tied to its
technological manifestation when dealing-] {+position 123 are interacting+} with [-interfaces, and the nature of-] the [-group’s
philosophy of data may strongly inform its presentation of data. For example, a group-] {+position 122s
in your experiment?
Participant: And+} with [-a more subjective philosophy of data would require more ability-] {+me. So: experimental position 123 as opposed+} to [-filter, especially-]
{+people actually building+} the [-ability-] {+real noun 118. They were somebody else.

Interviewer: What flows are there from the position 122s+} to [-export mental filters into-] the [-program. An objective group-] {+experimental position 123?
Participant: I would give them plans.

Interviewer: Labeled as plans or drawings?
Participant: Drawings. Information. Wait, No I+} would {+say it’s Data,
it’s numbers. I+} want
[-more ability to dig into the provenance-] {+a sheet+} of [-data and look at what they would consider-] {+steel cut+} to
[-be the meta-data-] {+these dimensions, surface
treated+} in [-an attempt to assess the quality of the data.

The philosophy of data is also a-] {+this way, joined in this way, join it in this+} way [-for designers-] to [-understand the subjective
reality-] {+this other
piece+} of {+steel here.

Interviewer: And that’s just Data.

Participant: That’s just Data. They didn’t tell them+} the [-group. The philosophy of data touches on many questions-] {+intent+} of [-knowing
related-] {+what I
was going+} to [-business practices. While-] {+do. The position 123 is+} not [-directly related, assessing how a group decides
that things are “known” and how-] {+expected to interpret anything,+}
they [-assess data informs their use of language and
their expectations of “information” technology. Better understanding of how-] {+just manufacture.

Interviewer: If+} they [-think
can lead-] {+were expecting+} to {+interpret,+} the [-presentation of both more novel and (one hopes) more intuitively useful
prototypes to those who-] {+position 122s+}
would [-use them.

This philosophy-] {+be sending?
Participant: Information, we would like the device to do this, please
make sure that it+} can [-also form part of-] {+do this. But usually, if+} the [-basis of design for larger systems. One of-] {+position 122s were
talking to them, they didn’t say that. They said: here’s+} the [-many problems confronting interfaces that require mass adoption is-] {+drawing,
make that.

Interviewer: The experimental position 123 then do what with+} that [-people’s
differing philosophies-]
{+Data flow?
Participant: they’ll build equipment.

Interviewer: Does building+} of [-data cause them to form different expectations-] {+equipment represent some sort+} of [-the interfaces,
simply by changing the users’ mental models-] {+flow+}
of {+Data, Information, or Knowledge?
Participant: It’s+} the [-system’s affordances. A designer
who thinks about philosophies-] {+embodiment+} of [-data can set up appropriate scaffolding in-] {+the Data.

Interviewer: Is embodied Data+} a [-program
in anticipation-] {+flow+} of [-users’ differing philosophies,-] {+Data?
Participant: Yeah, I’d say it would be. After that, the equipment position
123 walks away+} and [-thereby head off user-experience
complaints before they arrive.


8.3 Conclusion
The SDFN is-] {+you have+} a [-powerful tool that can be used-] {+device there which has the embodiment
of Data+} in [-many different disciplines. Although it was
conceived as a tool for X-Phi, no inherent restrictions prevent its use for meaning discovery. It is just as valid for exploring moral philosophy as-] {+it. But you don’t know where+} it {+came from.

Interviewer: So there+} is [-for exploring organizational
dynamics and behavior.

In the business world, it-] {+a flow there.

Participant: Yes.

Interviewer: Where+} is {+that flow here? Do we need+} an [-excellent tool for identifying potential silos, and
for enhancing user experience and database design:-] {+equipment entity?
Participant: No, I’d put+} it [-can uncover peoples’ subjective
realities without any need to reconcile multiple realities-] into [-any kind-] {+the experiment. Because everything
there was included in the experiment.


Interviewer: So this embodiment+} of [-“objective
world.” As-] {+Data is+} a [-practical and pragmatic tool refreshingly free-] {+flow+} of [-jargon, it may prove quite
useful in-] {+Data?
Participant: Data, yes. So+} the [-business world.

The philosophy-] {+piece+} of [-data also has its use, independently-] {+equipment is Data.

Interviewer: How do we want to label this flow. Piece+} of [-the SDFN, as an item-] {+equipment or
embodiment?
Participant: Piece+} of
[-great consideration in consulting efforts and design efforts.-] {+equipment.

Interviewer:+} The [-nature-] {+experimental position 123 send a piece+} of [-an organization’s philosophy-] {+equipment
to the experiment. This piece+} of [-data should inform-] {+equipment is a Data flow because+} the [-tenor and nature-]
{+piece+} of [-suggestions-] {+equipment embodies Data.

Participant: Yes.

Interviewer: Do the experimental position 123 send anything else+} to
the
[-organization and-] {+experiment?
Participant: Not to+} the [-basis of-] {+experiment. They send+} a [-consultant’s understanding. It is also an important mechanism for designers of all stripes-] {+bill+} to [-understand as another factor affecting how their
clients’ perceptions of constructed reality differ from their own.


9 Further Research Directions
Unlike potential applications,-] {+me or someone
else,+} the [-research directions offered in this chapter are less
useful-] {+position 124.

Interviewer: Do we want+} to [-industry. Instead, this chapter focuses on detailing-] {+model+} the [-limits of my research
and some research directions in which it-] {+position 124?
Participant: No.

Interviewer: So they, to you, send what? A bill? They+} can [-be expanded. As this is the first foray of-] {+send multiple
things.

Participant: Usually+} the
[-philosophy-] {+piece+} of [-data into X-Phi, there are-] {+equipment, we either pick it up on+} a [-great many research directions, far beyond the
scope of this document.-]
{+vehicle or it gets delivered here. They don’t pass anything to me. What+}
I [-will explore questions of breadth, depth, other philosophies,
and methodology, as all of these areas can profitably expand the philosophy of data. Most
of this chapter will be in-] {+get from them is+} the [-nature of open questions, rather than detailed research
protocols into specific areas.

Questions-] {+piece+} of [-breadth explore the design space. My current findings-] {+equipment. It doesn’t+} have [-not demonstrated many of the theoretically possible philosophies of data nor their interactions.

My open questions of breadth rather aim-] to [-suggest potential explorations into different
philosophies of data, defining some of the boundaries of the field or pointing toward the
unknown unknowns.

Questions of depth seek-] {+come+} to [-elaborate on-]
{+me, so long as it ends up at+} my [-current research, generating more
evidence and increasing the persuasive reliability of what-] {+experiment, that’s all+} I [-have discovered so far. New
applications of-] {+care about.

Interviewer: So is there a flow from+} the [-present research methodology and further triangulation of my results
are necessary before-] {+position 123 to you?
Participant: No.

Interviewer: Ok. Are there+} any [-particularly persuasive case may be made.-] {+other entities?
Participant:+} There [-are many areas where useful intuitive philosophical exploration may be
found. Although this research is X-Phi, certain areas can be profitably explored by someone using analytic or continental philosophy. This section suggests some potential links
in those areas.

The SDFN-] is a [-useful, if barely tested, innovation. Quite a lot of research may be

performed on the SDFN itself, making it a better and more accurate tool for the purposes
of X-Phi. This section therefore also details some potential changes or extensions-] {+flow from me+} to [-the
methodology.

Finally, I take some of the open questions and explore potential specific research
projects that may be useful. This discussion provides a shortcut for future research
proposals and a way of dividing interesting work.


9.1 Questions of Breadth
The philosophy of data warrants further investigation. My research indicates-] {+them. And+} that [-different people have different philosophies of data, but many major questions remain to-] {+will+} be
[-explored. So far, my research has merely illuminated part-] of the [-“design space” of-]
{+same form as what they get from+} the
[-field. The idea of a design space can be applied-] {+position 122.

Interviewer: So you send them drawings?
Participant: No. From me they’re more likely+} to [-any discipline. Put simply,-] {+get an intent. They’re
going to get Information. Because I’m not+} a [-design
space articulates-] {+position 122 or+} a [-range of possible options, orthogonal to each other. It would be silly-] {+mechanical
position 58. And I know the function I want it+} to [-think-] {+have, but I may not
know+} that {+you need to make it out ... [of.]
Interviewer: So you, to the experimental position 123, send intent. Is+}
this [-research has even uncovered many-] {+intent an expression+} of [-the axes.

How does data relate to context? The data-as-observation philosophies believe-] {+Information, Data, or Knowledge?
Participant: That will be Information.

Interviewer: What else do we have? Are there other entities+} that [-context allows the construction of information-] {+are

Interviewer: And they’re interacting...

Participant: They interact with me.


Interviewer: position 56s+} do [-data-as-facts

Participant: They’ll, I’ll show them... sometimes they actually help
doing+} the [-context of data? Are there hidden contexts that indicate data’s

show them Data from the experiments.

Interviewer: So you send them numbers?
Participant: Yes.

Interviewer:+} Are [-relationships context,-] {+these numbers the same numbers,+} or do [-they form their own category?
How does measurement relate-] {+you transform
them somehow?
Participant: No, if I’m going+} to [-data? Does measurement create data, or is it
merely-] {+talk to them, I’ll send them real numbers.

Interviewer: Functionally you don’t perform any other task than switching.

Participant: Correct. It’s as if the experiment was sending them numbers. Not all like.. but for+} a [-transformation of intrinsic properties? Is data creatable via observation and
is that observation then-] {+time,+} a [-measurement? How does error in measurement,-] {+season... there’s a fellow position 56+}
and [-even
further, imprecision, change the nature-] {+I’ll need to double-check or get a second opinion or “can you help
me with this kind+} of {+thing?” and they’ll get+} the [-data represented?

Do-] {+raw+} numbers [-matter? Some philosophies within data-as-communications-] and [-dataas-facts require their data-] {+we’ll
have it.

Interviewer: So the numbers from the experiment go+} to [-be numerical. Is this requirement a reaction against-] the
[-imprecision of language or-] {+position
56s. This I assume is+} a [-function of some other element of peoples’ philosophy?
How are numbers viewed-] {+Data flow?
Participant: Yes
Interviewer: Do you send anything+} to [-produced objective data, and can subjective interpretations-] {+the position 56s?
Participant: Yes, I’ll+} be [-rendered as data to turn them into objective assertions?
How do sender and receiver matter? Has Shannon’s [81] specification of information communication created philosophies of data? Are there realistic ways to use-] {+talking, in+} the
[-model outside of ill thought-out metaphors? How does-] {+system I’ve worked out here, Data
is+} the [-nature-] {+raw numbers. Information is an interpretation+} of [-semiotics inform
the philosophy-] {+those numbers. And Knowledge is an embodiment+} of [-data? When people think-] {+something, a real physical
operating device+} of [-data as signs, which semiotic model fits
better, and does-] the [-semiotic model change-] {+company. So it’s something that we’re going to
write down and keep+} for [-different people? [82]
Is data embodied in-] {+posterity and keep using. With+} the [-universe? This question is another way of exploring-] {+position
56s, ... I’ll stop modeling+} the
[-subjectivity/objectivity split, with some interesting implications-] {+Data for a while+} and [-links to other philosophical fields. Exploring the belief of embodiment could-] {+just talk about it. It’ll+}
be [-a good way-] {+where... I see something interesting, but I want+} to [-integrate this
research into other multidisciplinary studies.

One of the most pressing aspects of-] {+make sure that
it’s actually a reasonable conclusion. That it’s a sensible thing. That
another person in my shoes will also reach. So I’ll do+} the [-philosophy-] {+interpretation+}
of [-data is-] the [-question of data’s
fundamental nature-] {+Data myself,+} and [-how it relates-] {+I’ll also ask them+} to [-information and knowledge. Although the philosophy of data is not strongly interested in the fundamental philosophies of information
and knowledge, an exploration of the hierarchies from the perspective of the philosophy of data may produce some novel results. The philosophies of both information and
knowledge explore their fields’ questions of being, but they explore them mainly from a
“top-down” perspective, noting that information or knowledge is the most important
element in the relationship.

The philosophy of data can contribute-] {+review it,+} to {+have+} a [-bottom-up hierarchy. It explores not
the final and polished product,-] {+look at
it. And see if it’s a sensible conclusion. So they often would have gotten
some raw numbers,+} but {+they’ll also get+} the [-fundamental components of that product as
perceived by people. Many of the intuitions of both-] {+Information.

Interviewer: Is it+} the [-philosophy of knowledge and

195-] {+same Information+} that [-of information can-] {+you would+} be [-explored through various X-Phi protocols. By looking at these
other philosophies through the lens of-] {+sending to+}
the [-philosophy of data,-] {+position 22? Or is+} it [-may-] {+different?
Participant: It’ll+} be [-possible to
confirm, substantiate, and question their findings.

Exploring relationships between data and other elements of knowing-] {+different.

Interviewer: What shall we label it?
Participant: It varies,+} from [-the
philosophy of data’s point of view-] {+time to time. It’ll be Information or it may
even be Knowledge about an experiment.

Interviewer: Are these different flows?
Participant: Yes.

Interviewer: What+} is [-also useful. We can explore-] the [-relationships between-] {+Information flow about+} the [-different elements and examine how different people conceptualize and use those
relationships, articulating-] {+experiment that
you as position 56 send to+} the [-differences between theoretical definition and practical
use. Methodologies can be created-] {+position 56s?

Participant: I’m trying+} to {+thing of specific examples here so I’m not
vague.

Interviewer: Vague is fine.

Participant: If it was an Information case, it would be, I have seen ...

when we do x, y, z, I+} see [-if people (and computer systems) understand
data to be-] {+behavior a, b, c in+} the [-first element of-] {+rig. And I’d call that
Information. And I’d usually ask them to review+} the [-hierarchy,-] {+Data, look at+} the [-ultimate element, or merely-]
{+Data, and say do you think that’s reasonable observation? However,
if I’ve seen+} a [-component-] {+class+} of {+behaviors or+} a [-circuit. From there, investigations can be conducted-] {+systematic response+} to [-see how people know and
categorize these different “priorities” or products of data.

Another investigation concerns-] the [-semiotic representations of data. There are
many avenues of investigation-] {+rig+}
to [-see whether data-] {+whatever it+} is [-more appropriately understood
in-] {+I throw at it, then I would say – then I’m talking to
them about Knowledge. And it will be Knowledge about either+} the [-traditional-] {+rig
itself+} or {+about some phenomenon we may see on+} the [-Peircian views of semiotics [73]. Beyond that, the nature of-] {+noun 118. So it’s
something to ...

Interviewer: So you send them an Information flow and a Knowledge
flow. Let’s label+} the [-representation, being sign-] {+Knowledge flow first. It’s a Knowledge flow about
phenomena+} or [-electronic, can be investigated. Jacob Voss [16] is
studying-] the [-linguistic patterns-] {+rig?
Participant: It’ll be as though it’s a physical law+} of [-data, extending Gray’s work in differentiating data
from information [83], exploring-] {+something or another.

Interviewer: So potential physical law?
Participant: Yes.. Potential physical law? It’s something on which I can
predict+} the [-potentially unique relationships between bits, bytes,
strings, and-] {+future.

Interviewer: whereas+} the [-other artifacts of computer representation. Research-] {+Information is... correlation? request+} to [-falsify data’s
linguistics or-]
{+confirm correlation?
Participant: It’s a request+} to [-explore the differences between it and the linguistics of written data can
be quite profitable.

Questions on objectivity and subjectivity persist. A person’s beliefs about data
may suggest whether or-] {+confirm correlation. I think I’m seeing
behavior x, y, z. Do you see it to?
Interviewer: But, because it’s only a correlation, it’s only Information?
Participant: Yes, that’s right, it’s+} not [-data, as an abstract, can be objective, but their assessment
of each incoming data, piece of data, data set, or datum (depending on their academic
background) indicates-] {+a predictive tool. I can’t... rather
than saying, I think I understand+} the [-subjectivity of any given element.

Nevertheless, questions of subjectivity-] {+mechanism behind this thing that
we’re seeing,+} and [-objectivity require significant research.


The first question is the essential one: how does someone know whether something-] {+I think that this+} is [-objective or subjective? Beyond-] the [-direct questions-of-knowledge, “how do people
know-] {+explanation for it, and if+} that [-something-]
{+explanation+} is [-data?” are questions such as: Are-] {+correct than I can predict+} the [-elements that contribute-] {+future. If you throw x, y, z,
at it it’s going+} to [-subjectivity or objectivity themselves data? Are they situated in a knowledge or information framework? How does an assessment of objectivity influence future interactions
with the data?
There are also interesting interactions with-] {+produce this effect. That’s probably+} the [-philosophy-] {+Information+}
and [-sociology of science.

Data, to many people, informs the nature of fact. Whether data is-] {+Knowledge difference.

Interviewer: They have three flows going into them. Then what happens?
Participant: They’ll hate me because I’ve given them work. They’ll
laugh at me...

Interviewer: Just+} a [-fact or merely
informs the construction of facts may therefore inform peoples’ philosophies of data.

The question of reproducibility, while related to subjectivity and objectivity,-] {+second,+} is [-one of
the fundamental questions-] {+that a flow? Is that expression+} of {+resentment?
Participant: Actually, no, it’s often more interest. Particularly when
it’s+} the [-theory of science, with many different discussions as to
objects and people transporting scientific knowledge. The relationship-] {+Knowledge kind+} of [-data and facts
to data and reproducibility-] {+thing.

Interviewer: Is that a flow?
Participant: Their immediate response before anything else happens?
Interviewer: Yes.


Participant: I guess so, a positive response is always encouraging.

Interviewer: What it+} is a [-vital one-] {+flow of?
Participant: Peer support.

Interviewer: There’s a flow back+} to [-establish through X-Phi.

Exploring the scientific nature of data also raises questions-] {+you+} of [-analysis. Specifically,
analysis-] {+peer support sometimes.

Participant: Peer/professional support. This+} is [-a transformation applied by one thing-] {+going+} to [-another thing. Some people, in-] {+get more vague
and nebulous as we go on. I’d say it’s just Information. It’s very ... it’s
not numbers, it’s not ... although it could be... no, ... this morning, we
talked about+} the
[-interviews, stated-] {+case where [someone was] saying something ridiculously beyond+} the [-belief that analysis transformed data into information. Yet there
are interesting questions-] {+laws+} of [-how people analyze data so-] {+physics. Even a first year undergraduate
would recognize+} that [-they can contextualize, filter,
or refine it. Questions of analysis are those-] {+it’s just a loopy kind+} of [-affordances, virtual though they may be.

How-] {+thing to say. And how+}
do [-people conceptualize data such-] {+you correct+} that [-they know they can manipulate it? Where
do these conceptualizations come from? How do they know what they know, especially
from-] {+kind of thing? It’s more than just Knowledge,+} the [-perspective-]
{+professional support+} of [-data?
The other aspect-] {+a positive response+} to [-be investigated of data-as-fact-] {+a hypothesis+} is [-the nature-] {+kind+} of [-its structure and
potential meta-data. How do people conceptualize relationships, meta-data, and other
structural elements of data? Is-]
{+acknowledgement that things are... that you’re on+} the [-structure of data itself data? How does-] {+right track. So
it’s Information there. Because+} the [-structure
of data influence our understanding-] {+person has noun 97ed it at least
slightly. Ever so little bit. And it hasn’t knocked up any red flags to say
that this is stupid. So it’s Information. It’s an immediate interpretation+}
of [-it,-] {+what’s in there. They haven’t looked at it in detail+} and {+found specific
problems or errors with it or things like that.

Interviewer: Now+} are [-we aware of the structure when we

understand-] {+there any flows beyond that “Hey, that looks
cool.”?
Participant: Eventually, I hope that they come back with+} a [-piece of data? How does software implement our mental maps of structure,
and how can we improve-] {+technical
comment about it,+} that [-structural mapping?
Although all of these questions are-] {+they’ve thought more deeply about it. That
would be+} a [-start, the main goal of short-term research
in-] {+critique.

Interviewer: So+} this [-area should-] {+critique is: Data, Information, Knowledge?
Participant: Information I would say. And there will also+} be [-the generation of new questions. Too many unknown unknowns
exist: the boundaries of the question “what is data?” are not well defined.


9.2 Questions of Depth
The preceding section raises many links-] {+times
where they will also come back+} with [-other philosophies. Moreover, for many
identified areas, I simply do not know-] {+Knowledge. Often based on+} the [-right questions-]
{+Data themselves.

Interviewer: So they can send+} to [-ask. However, other avenues
of explorations are available.-] {+you Knowledge.+} This [-research has explored an extremely small sample size,
merely proving that there is something here. Further research must explore-] {+Knowledge flow
is?
Participant: They look at+} the [-two
basic questions of interest.

The research needs to-] {+raw Data, and they think they can see
systematic behavior which can+} be [-applied-] {+used in a predictive way+} to {+predict
the future.

Interviewer: Would you say it’s+} the same [-and new organizations. In-] {+Data flow that you send to
them?
Participant: It’s of+} the same
[-organization, performing a similarly scoped interview process on-] {+nature, yes.

Interviewer: Does it have+} a different [-group would
provide an interesting comparison with my original research. Extending from there,-] {+label?
Participant: No I give it+} the
[-low-key interviews (taking very little organization time) must also be conducted across
different types-] {+same label.

Interviewer: Really, it’s a bidirectional data flow.

Participant: And that’s really good when that happens. In part, that’s
the kind+} of [-organizations, including research, business, and others. Many useful
intuitions-] {+the embodiment that I’m replaceable. And that we are
actually doing science. The fact that somebody else+} can [-be gleaned by looking-] {+look+} at [-different groups, organizations,-] {+the raw
Data+} and [-industries,
even-] {+come up+} with {+that Knowledge is good. That’s how science
operates. It should be independent of+} the [-“choose your own topic” technique used-] {+observer.


Interviewer: One of my other hats is philosopher of science. I would
say that you guys are engaged+} in {+a Lakatosian research programme
<explanation of Lakatos>
Interviewer: From what you described,+} the [-interviews-] {+refinement of theories+} and [-survey
above.

At-]
the [-same time,-] {+research of theories is+} a [-way to further increase the depth-] {+research programme. Because you’re not
really questioning your inner assumptions+} of [-the studies would be-] {+“this is Noun 23, this is
what it does. We know it, we’re not going+} to [-run-] {+go: ‘hey, I’ve discovered+}
a [-series-] {+new property of Noun 23’ we’re going ‘hey, here’s this refinement+} of [-more rigorous (and therefore longer) interviews exploring-]
the [-same topical
area with every participant. Because every participant would be exploring-] {+outer shell.’
Participant: that’s right. ... we don’t question+} the [-same
area, their diagrams would be made commensurate and differences could be found and

articulated. The area diagrammed would have-] {+laws of physics. We
try+} to [-be something in which many people-] {+find out how they’re expressed+} in {+a very specific set of circumstances.

...

Interviewer: Do we have any other interactions here? Perhaps a couple
of Knowledge interactions? Interactions with ...

Participant: I guess we never got to+} the [-organization participated, because-] {+end of it,+} the [-answers from workers in-] {+other roles or
things like that. Do we want to go onto other roles of me?
Interviewer: Absolutely.

Participant: Because then we have time... during+} the [-same area are
likely-] {+first adjective 96
we were involved in, we would actually take measurements and giving
immediate advice on those. It was convenient for me+} to be [-similar even if they-] {+in that role,
but it didn’t+} have [-different philosophies of data. The similarity can be
predicted from the people’s need-] to [-share a common vocabulary and therefore-] {+be+} a [-roughly
common worldview of the scenario.

Exploration-] {+position 56 as such.

Interviewer: But it was part+} of this [-scenario could also be exported into a survey, once the interviews were complete. The survey would postulate elements within the area-] {+noun 97?
Participant: It was part+} of [-concern
about which people would express-] the [-most agreement and disagreement. If-] {+project, yes.

Interviewer: So what shall we call that role?
Participant: Whether+} the [-survey is held to be commensurate with-] {+person in+} the [-interviews and if participation is restricted-] {+position 56 hat+} to
[-those inside an organization,-] {+be that person
or not?
Interviewer: That’s+} the [-survey could become-] {+beauty of just labeling it as+} a [-much more valuable tool for
understanding-] {+role. You as+} the [-different philosophies of data present.


9.3 Intuitive-philosophical justification
Although increases in breadth and increases-] {+position 56 can send flows to you+} in [-depth would be-] {+that role. We don’t have to instantiate
roles really.

Participant: I’ll talk around it a bit first to help clean my mind. The
person who fulfilled that role+} needed to [-pursue it, the
other significant area of research required is-] {+be+} in [-formal philosophy. The initial, experimental investigation has suggested many different potential philosophies-] {+charge+} of [-data, but
there is significant room for intuitive-philosophical thinking.

It is not an objective-] {+a small team.

Who would take measurements using temporary pieces+} of {+equipment
on the noun 118. This isn’t using normal noun 118 Noun 4, we actually put extra cameras and extra+} this [-research to burn bridges. Nothing in this document
should be construed-] {+and extra that up there+} to [-indicate any kind of negative view-] {+take
measurements+} of [-intuitive-philosophical
work. While X-Phi is excellent at probing-] {+what was happening when+} the [-philosophies of people-] {+noun 118+} and [-even generating
surprising conclusions, the acts-] {+bits+} of [-synthesis and imagination fall mainly in-]
{+equipment were being run for+} the [-domain-] {+first couple+} of {+times. They weren’t
being run with+} the [-intuitive philosophers.

Beyond synthesis, the inductive exploration-] {+noun 118 being all operating, So it was slightly contrived. But it’s part+} of [-discovered philosophies from X-Phi
methodologies, there exists a requirement for intuitive-philosophy-] {+adjective 96+} to [-cover-] {+make sure that everything works
properly. that you push button a and things happen as they should.

Interviewer: “If we push button A, does pipe A actually flow?”
Participant: Does it do+} the [-same
basic ground. Is-] {+thing we expect+} it [-possible for an intuitive-philosopher-] to [-find and discuss the three

domains of data-] {+do? During+} that [-I have discovered in this research? Plying an imaginative gaze over
the unmapped design space, the intuitive philosopher may discover different nodes, or
different ways-] {+there
needed to be a bunch+} of [-thinking about-] {+measurements taken so that they could be

analyzed to confirm that+} the [-three major types of philosophies.

The research I have performed here should-] {+noun 95 intent was being met. So that it
could be confirmed to+} be [-reproducible through normal philosophy. Because-] the [-gathered evidence roughly reflects extant definitions,-] {+noun 95 intent as best as we could tell.

And you needed somebody in that role who was familiar with+} the [-armchair
philosopher would find no novel, unexpected cases. A long-] {+noun
95 intent+} and [-deep consideration of
the relationships of-] {+with+} the [-three philosophies may provide additional elements-] {+equipment that was needed+} to [-test or
project unexpected consequences of one-] {+take those extra
measurements.

Interviewer: Let’s label this role.

Participant: That’s adjective 96 ... are we separating the role from the
actual measurements? I would say that’s that way. It’s different from
experiments. noun 126s is what they were.

Interviewer: These noun 126s, what entity sends them flows?
Participant: The main purpose+} of the [-three philosophies.

Although my intent-] {+noun 126s+} is to [-create a practical philosophy of data, one-] {+find out+} that [-is functional
and useful-]
{+when you press button A that things happen as they should So it was
the position 122s, they send+} to [-practitioners, a good theory is itself quite practical. Involving formal
philosophers, philosophers of science, and philosophers of technology in-] the [-exploration
of-] {+noun 126s, I guess it was Information.

Interviewer: Information about?
Participant: Not+} the [-philosophy of data can generate-] {+noun 126s themselves. They’re not+} a [-great deal of theory. If-] {+self-aware
entity. So they just receive Data.

Interviewer: So here’s+} the [-ultimate goal is
kept-] {+thing. It depends if+} the [-same,-] {+noun 75s are
Participant: There wasn’t somebody who wasn’t on the noun 95 team
or in the Position 22 camp who was running the noun 75s.

Interviewer: So if you want+} to [-generate theory-] {+put+} that {+person in the noun 75s you’re
welcome to, or you+} can [-drive real practice, then-] {+have them be a separate entity.

Participant: Yeah, position 125s.

Interviewer: do we want to make an entity for+} the [-participation of
philosophers-] {+position 125.

Participant: Yeah, separate the people+} from [-other domains could be quite fruitful.

Philosophies of science and technology tend-] {+the actual noun 97.

Interviewer: So the position 122s+} to [-involve data in some degree. By
involving-] the [-practical aspect of this philosophy in their research, philosophers may-] {+noun 75s send what?
Participant: Data, numbers.

Interviewer: These numbers have what... what numbers are hey sending?
Participant: It could+} be
[-able to export functional practices to people-] {+embodied Data+} in {+physical equipment. So+} the [-working world. Their participation
as translators is encouraged, but beyond translation, the philosophers of technology-]
{+actual noun 118 top.

Interviewer: Equipment.

Participant: Equipment+} and
[-science can serve-] {+that’s what they provided+} to [-frame questions of data:-] {+the noun 75s.

Interviewer: What are+} they [-can situate, via footnotes, different
philosophies of data within their work, and in-] {+providing to the position 58?
Participant: They’re sending him Information. And+} that [-way both frame their work and
indicate why certain people believe certain things about science and technology.

Finally,-] {+was+} the [-intuitive-philosophical component of philosophy may be a useful and
practical matter of exploration for practical engineering-] {+designs+} and [-database communities. Although-] the [-experimental component may be better at describing what is, it is likely that-] {+operating manuals.

Interviewer: Flows from+} the [-intuitive component is better at describing what should be. Arranging a collabora-

tive exploration between-] {+position 58s to+} the [-three peoples, intuitive, experimental, and practical, may
encourage-] {+noun 75s.

Participant: From+} the [-conduct of research into new ways of thinking about all these conceptions
of data. Once those new ways are explored, they can be tested by-] {+position 125 to+} the [-practical users-] {+noun 75s?
Interviewer: All+} of the [-philosophy and then assessed by the experimental side of things.


9.4 Methodological-] {+above.


Participant:+} The [-SDFN, as a tool, requires refinement and research. It may be an excellent way to model
a business, but it requires significant research before it may produce useful results. It
creates an extremely subjective look at how people inside the business see their own business. Quite a lot of study will be necessary before-] {+position 125 also got Information from+} the [-SDFN can present a compelling story
that both communicates effectively and provides value to participants and sponsors.

As a way of understanding what people think about-] {+position
22.

Interviewer: And+} what is [-going on inside an
organization, the SDFN could-] {+this Information?
Participant: It would+} be a [-very useful tool. More research-] {+request. They tell them, when we usually run
the noun 118, this+} is [-needed-] {+how we tend+} to [-create
methodologies for performing interviews, especially in choosing a topic that will-] {+operate the equipment. I want you
to make sure we+} cover
[-multiple peoples’ interviews, exploring how people create categories, presenting category lists without introducing too much bias, and exploring more ephemeral definitions
than those-] {+that kind+} of [-a relatively well known term such as “data.”
At present, the SDFN-] {+operation in your noun 75s.

Interviewer: So request for noun 75s maybe?
Participant: Request for performance+} is [-an excellent way of creating an artifact-] {+a better description. For example, there’s no need+} for [-discussion. Assessment purely on-] the [-methodology is needed-] {+position 125+} to [-see if it can produce consistent results
within groups of people. Furthermore,-] {+run+} the [-methodological description in an earlier
chapter, while sufficient, probably fails to articulate many unconscious adaptations performed-] {+conveyor belt
by startstopstartstop. You don’t need+} to [-increase the quality-] {+test that because we never do
that. It actually is physically capable+} of [-interviews. In many ways, meta-research needs-] {+doing that, but we don’t care
about that kind of testing. It’s not going+} to [-be
conducted with an external party modeling-] {+happen.

Interviewer: To test it+} the [-SDFN process before other people can
make full use of it.


201-] {+way we want the performance.

Participant:+} The [-bubble diagram is quite useful, though limited due to its subjectivity. New
ways of modeling-] {+way we usually do it+} and [-representing-] the [-SDFN are required, especially-] {+reasonable boundaries
that that...

Interviewer: and these requests+} for [-analyzing the
diagram outside the context of-] {+performance are Information. Do+}
the [-interview. This research should-] {+position 125s receive anything else from anybody?
Participant: Yes, they’ve got Information+} also {+from me as position 56.

And that would+} be [-related-] {+Information of a similar nature, but+} to {+say this is+}
the
[-“objectivity” research mentioned above, to try to produce useful stories or reproducible
results from-] {+new behavior that we’re looking for, please make sure that+} the [-methodology. It is essential-]
{+noun 75s test+} that {+area. We want to measure+} the [-SDFN be a useful tool for people who
require objectivity-] {+behavior under this
circumstance. Please make sure that circumstance happens during that
noun 75+} and [-people who embrace subjectivity in their research. If-] {+that we have+} the [-bubble
diagram is attached-] {+ability+} to [-one doctrinal camp-] {+measure it.

Interviewer: So request for measurement.

Participant: Request for measurement. And that was just from me
though. I was the position 56 so everything was coming through me,+}
or {+that role. And then+} the [-other, large segments-] {+position 125 wouldn’t give feedback to any+}
of [-potential
researchers will dismiss-] {+us. They said what was possible. So they told us what their plan was.

Interviewer: Were they talking about plans or feasibility?
Participant: Plans.

Interviewer: Who were they sending plans back to?
Participant: Everybody who told them things. ... And then+} it [-out-] {+was the
same Information came back to all+} of [-hand, when it could potentially be a very useful tool for-] {+us.

Interviewer: So they’re sending+} their [-work.

The SDFN requires significant further research. Fundamentally, it is barely tried and
tested-] {+plans+} as [-a methodology. Creating a way-] {+Information+} to [-assess its efficacy-] {+position
56, position 22,+} and [-reduce uncertainties
regarding potential bias is vital. Researching more methods of analysis, especially ones-] {+position 122s.

Participant: They found it convenient to send everything to everyone.

Because then everyone could say: “No no no, you’ve missed X, please
change your plans.”
Interviewer: Is+} that [-can be performed by groups of people is also worthwhile.

The first large area of methodological validation should be in the failure modes-] {+no-no-no you missed X a different Data flow?
Participant: no, it was reinforcement+} of the [-SDFN. What behaviors during an interview cause an SDFN-] {+previous Information. ???

Interviewer: Are there any Knowledge or Data flows+} to [-fail? How is failure
defined? How does failure affect other interviews? Where are-] the [-sources of subjectivity
and bias? What is an appropriate amount of scaffolding for-] {+position
125?
Participant: Well, there would be some Data included with+} the [-interviewer-] {+Information. It’s usually interpreted Data. You don’t want+} to [-provide?
Where does the documentation fail, such that someone reading the methodology is not
able-] {+give raw numbers
coming from anybody. We’re expecting them+} to [-run-] {+generate or+} their [-own SDFN? Where does the bubble analysis fail? What conclusions should
not be reached when considering the SDFN?
All of-] {+noun
126s to generate raw numbers. Then they’d run+} the [-above questions can lead-] {+noun 75. So they
send Data+} to [-larger or smaller amounts of failure before,
after, or during-] the [-running of-] {+noun 75. They say+} the [-SDFN. Beyond those questions, however,-] {+set points.

Interviewer: So noun 75 specifications?
Participant: Yes.

Interviewer: These+} are [-questions
of reliability. As a subjective tool, the idea of reproducibility is difficult to credit: interviewing a person multiple times will, by necessity, produce different results-] {+Data?
Participant: Yes.

Interviewer: These noun 75 specifications+} as [-they
update their mental models with-] {+Data are sent to+} the [-contents of prior interviews. However, that result

increases-] {+noun
126s. These noun 75s take+} the [-difficulties-] {+noun 75 specifications and the equipment,
the Data embodied+} in [-discussing-] the [-reliability-] {+equipment, and do what?
Participant: It just operates. When I think+} of [-the SDFN. Subjective social research relies on telling a “compelling story” [8] that may resonate with aspects-] {+noun 126s, I think+} of [-what
the audience understands about the world, by providing explanatory power for things
that-] the [-researchers may not have conceptualized. The pure-subjective story here is also
limited, as-]
{+piece of equipment that’s over there set up in+} the [-SDFN and interview-] {+way it should be
plus people who+} are [-designed primarily to elicit definitions.

As the SDFN straddles the subjective-objective barrier, quite a lot of research will
need to-] {+there who might+} be [-done on its reliability. Measurements-] {+actually operating+} or [-assessments of reliability need to
be created. Different SDFN runs-] {+pressing
buttons. But they’re not necessarily... these are my instructions. I+} must [-be commensurate in terms of reliability such that
it is possible-]
{+press this button at this time. Or talk+} to [-say “this was a bad run”-] {+so+} and [-to refer to some external reason for-] {+so. And we do+} the
[-interview failure. The danger of subjectivity is that it is easy-] {+noun
75. Just do this.

Interviewer: These noun 75s send what+} to [-have interviews “fail”
when the participant does not agree with the interviewer; a rubric of reliability can in
many ways reduce that problem.

Another area of methodological research is-] {+whom?
Participant: We get Data. The position 125 gets Data from+} the [-categorical survey. Both-] {+noun 75.

Everybody who’s going to get it. In actuality, all four,+} the [-SDFN
and-] {+position 125s,+}
the [-survey present ways of probing meaning, although-] {+position 122s,+} the [-classification-throughscenario survey is clearly in need of significant refinement. The survey suffers from
many failure modes-] {+position 127s+} and [-reliability problems, just as-] {+myself were all there.

Interviewer: Basically+} the [-SDFN does.

Both reliability and failure modes hinge on-] {+noun 126s send+} a [-single problem: everyone needs-] {+flow+} to [-understand that they are taking the same survey. Investigation into the reliability of results
within an organization-] {+*2 which+} is [-also warranted, with time being dedicated to crosschecking-] the
[-survey against-]
{+distribution.

Participant: Yes, that’s right. As well as back to+} the [-SDFN-] {+position 125s.

Interviewer: That+} and [-both against other methods. Proving-] this [-survey methodology-] {+flow is?
Participant: adjective 96 Data.

Interviewer: And this adjective 96 Data+} is [-important because the survey deviates significantly from most established practice,
namely in that it invites self-reflection at every question, which inherently turns the survey into a far more subjective research vehicle with-] {+Data?
Participant: Yes.

Interviewer: Do+} the [-attendant risks of reproducibility,
falsification, and unpersuasive case studies.

On a more practical side,-] {+noun 126s send or get any other flows?
Participant: No.

Interviewer: Are we missing anything?
Participant: So+} the [-refinement necessary is-] {+noun 126s are+} in [-two parallel courses. Pri-

marily, the survey instructions need-] {+a way similar+} to [-be refined so that everyone understands-] the
[-survey-] {+experiments+}
in the [-same way. The identical understanding of questions is vital when investigating a large organization; otherwise, interpretation bias of the questions themselves
will make the results incommensurate. Along with the instructions for the questions,
the method of probing an interviewee’s initial role must be refined so-] {+way+} that [-it can explore
demographic and educational backgrounds while-] {+there’s Data going around. I think that’ll do, because
then you get into noun 118 operation. And that’s+} not [-breaking anonymity.

Even after-] {+part of the... most
of us are gone, it’s just+} the [-instructions-] {+Position 22s who+} are [-well tested and presented,-] {+doing their thing at
that point. Again, from+} the [-scenarios and-] {+noun 126s+} the
[-methodology for creating scenarios for a particular institution need to be refined so that
data which fits all discovered philosophies of-] data [-is described in a number of scenarios.

People must be allowed-] {+that say I get as position
56, I’ll feedback Information+} to [-resonate with many different-] {+the position 127s, as Information. But I
may also feed back Knowledge at that point.


Interviewer: So you’re sending+} interpretations of [-data, and-] {+measurements, but
they’re just different measurements. But it’s+} the
[-scenarios need to-] {+same flow.

Participant: It’s the same flow. At that point, I may+} be [-short but sufficiently clear-] {+sending Knowledge+} to [-resonate with-] the {+Position 22s. And that will be a+} different [-kinds of
philosophies.

Finally, an analysis methodology needs to-] {+thing. That’ll+}
be [-developed to compare explicitly-] {+a further refinement and converting+} the
[-results from the SDFN interview in a given department with a broader survey conducted
amongst the department. Although the simple method of reviewing the various philosophies of data and searching for correspondences was sufficient to fulfill my simple goals
in this research, more sophisticated techniques will be necessary-] {+Information+} to [-draw more refined
and useful conclusions.


9.5 Long-term projects
There are-] {+give it+} a [-number of long-term projects that could usefully and critically extend this
research. While the prior section explored the rough questions-]
{+predictive capability.

Interviewer: how do we want+} to [-inform the design
space of the philosophy of data and the failings of my methodologies,-] {+label this?
Participant: Operational understanding.

Interviewer: Does anyone else get+} this [-section will
propose specific research paths based on-] {+operational understanding?
Participant: Various people in+} the [-above section.


9.5.1 Organizational modeling
The first major research path should involve a large organizational modeling operation.

The intent is-] {+technical community. That may also
go+} to [-expand the scope of the research covered by-] the [-philosophy-] {+other position 56s, but it’s not really+} of [-data and
the SDFN-] {+use+} to {+them. It’s+} more [-interviews, more surveys, and, if possible, use an iterated approach-]
{+politeness+} to
[-extend the scope of both of-] them.

[-The initial plan for my current research was-]
{+Interviewer: Fundamentally speaking you’re sending the flow+} to [-explore-] the [-interactions-]
{+Position 22, though other people may receive it
Participant: It gets recorded+} in [-a small
group as an explicit pilot test of the methodology. Once conducted, I was to brief-] the
[-company on-] {+library, that kind of thing.

Interviewer: Let’s talk about+} the [-results-] {+library+} and [-then run another series of tests with-] {+books (which are different.)
does+} the [-company as-] {+library have+} a [-whole,
exploring the-] {+role here? And do books have a role here?
Participant: Oh yeah.

Interviewer: Let’s start with books. What+} interactions [-between different arms-] {+do these entities
have with books?
Participant: Internally generated documents? Or any kind+} of [-the company. The first 10 pilot
interviews provided more than sufficient research material.

With another opportunity-] {+recorded
Knowledge?
Interviewer: Do we want+} to [-do deep research in a company, I would first conduct
an interview in every interested department. The SDFN would be topically decided by-] {+differentiate those?
Participant: Probably not. Myself and+} the [-participant,-] {+position 122s+} and [-would serve both as advance advertising of-] the [-methodology to-] {+Position
22s. But mostly myself and+} the
[-company-] {+position 122s. We’ll get Knowledge from
books, from sources.

Interviewer: Call it books?
Participant: Call it books, but it means books+} and {+printed matter or
internet things. Not necessarily Wikipedia. Trusted sources of Information.

Interviewer: These books,+} as [-a way-] {+trusted sources+} of [-familiarizing myself with the activities-] {+Information, are sending ....

Participant: Trusted sources+} of [-the various departments. This research project, however, would not involve other interviewers, because
the methodology requires another, larger, more strenuous test before proper multi-interviewer participation is possible. A formal set-] {+Knowledge.

Interviewer: These books, as trusted sources+} of [-instructions, guidelines, and analysis
methods, beyond that given-] {+Knowledge, are sending
these three entities, although these two+} in [-chapter 3, must-] {+particular, what?
Participant: It’ll+} be [-developed before other interviewers
can reliably run the SDFN. Without a strict written framework, each interviewer will take
the SDFN research in their own direction, reducing possible commensurability.

With the initial interviews out of-] {+things like+} the [-way, I would execute my survey-] {+laws+} of [-the company.

By running the survey first, I can use it-] {+physics as applying+} to [-select participants and-] {+something close+} to [-get an idea of what
the company-] {+our area,+} as [-a whole thinks about data. By shaping the scenarios of the survey-] {+best as we can apply+} to
[-those found in the various interviews, I can make the survey topically relevant for the

company.

The survey will have an “enter contact information here” component that will allow
me-] {+our area.

Interviewer: These laws of physics are Knowledge?
Participant: Yeah.

Interviewer: Do you, or any of these entities, send anything+} to [-extend the survey into a proper SDFN interview. Although the contact information

eliminates anonymity-] {+books?

Participant: I’ll record. I try and write reports and documents of my
experiments once they’re complete.

Interviewer: So you as position 56 send documentation.

Participant: I’ll create documents, I’ll create books. Not very big ones.

Interviewer: But you’re sending+} to [-me *, subsequent interview/survey processing will insure that
the entire thing remains anonymous in any publications, depending on what serves-] the
[-research-] {+entity books...

Participant: Information+} and [-company interests-] {+Knowledge. Sometimes...

Interviewer: In+} the [-most.-] {+same flow or different flows?
Participant:+} In [-this first iteration, I will not try to have unified SDFN topics, as that requires a far
more polished SDFN methodology than allowing people to-] {+the same flow. Sometimes I’ll+} be [-their own subject matter
experts. Trying-] {+able+} to [-find-] {+deduce some
Knowledge.

Interviewer: So you send+} a [-topic to which multiple, self-selected people in different parts
of an organization can relate is an unnecessary difficulty in this proposed project.


9.5.2 Group modeling
Another research path is exploring the group dynamics-] {+flow+} of [-an SDFN.-] {+Information and Knowledge...+} This [-requires a smaller
group of 5-to-10 people, all-]
{+flow+} of [-whose members are willing to take part in the experiment.

As in the prior methodology, the first task will-] {+Information and Knowledge can+} be [-to present the group with a survey
containing scenarios tailored to their particular mission. These surveys will identify-] {+labeled...

Participant: What we did we call+} the
[-question-taker in each one, to see if their philosophies of-] data {+coming back to me?
Interviewer: Numbers.

Participant: Can we+} change [-when interacting
within the group
Once the surveys are conducted, six SDFN’s will be performed.-] {+that label to experimental Data?
Interviewer: Yes we can.

Participant:+} The [-first SDFN will be
with one of the “group leaders”-] {+experiment sends position 56+} and [-will ask to model something-] {+position 56s experimental Data. And my Information and Knowledge+} that [-has happened to
the entire group. This initial interview will be long running-] {+goes into books+}
or [-multi-part, such that-] {+documents is, call it experimental interpretation. Analysis? Maybe
analysis. Cross out interpretation. Experimental analysis. I use+} the
[-diagram can be sufficiently complete-]
{+term analysis in a lot of titles.

Interviewer: Do we want+} to [-cover any eventualities-] {+generalize this documentation or books?
Participant: Documentation.

Interviewer: So you send Information and Knowledge+} in [-subsequent groups.

*

While there are ways-] {+your experimental analysis+} to [-unlink contact information,-] the [-dissociation isn’t useful because surveys should
provide an initial sampling for subsequent interviews.-] {+docs.+} The [-ethical implications are not as important here
due-] {+docs send,+} to [-the theoretical domain-] {+these three people,
applied laws+} of [-research, but still pose some interesting problems.


Another important reason to involve-] {+physics, or pertinent laws of physics.

Participant: Yeah, pertinent. ... We differentiated here between+} the [-group leader in-]
{+library and+} the [-first interview-] {+books.

Interviewer: Is this here a worthwhile differentiation?
Participant: The library+} is [-that then
“legitimate research concerns” will prevent their subsequent participation in-] {+merely an internal convenient store for it as
opposed to, we can get into+} the [-group
SDFN session. A group leader usually has coercive disciplinary and fiscal power over-] {+local library down at [town name.].

Interviewer: So documentation is location independent, so therefore+}
the

[-other members of the group. Although in egalitarian organizations this coercion is less-] {+library exist as an entity outside+} of {+its documentation?
Participant: Yeah.

Interviewer: How do you request documentation? Is that+} a [-problem, any organization with-] {+flow, or is
that+} a [-culture-] {+flow or do you just get appropriate flows from them?
Participant: They’ll construct catalogues and things+} of [-fear will have its group results undermined by-] {+what they’ve
got.

Interviewer: Is+} the [-group leader’s presence due-] {+catalogue pertinent+} to {+this project?

Participant: No, not really. For+} the [-perception-] {+sake+} of [-inevitable punishment
for disagreement.

With the topic area defined by-] {+this project, we don’t generate that many books. Putting+} the [-group leader,-] {+library in it would be overkill.

...

Participant: I’m thinking that+} the [-next phase-] {+overall project+} is [-to run-] {+for the noun 95 of
the equipment of Noun 2. And I’m thinking that we’ve pretty much
covered everything in this project.

Interviewer: Let’s have+} a [-control
set-] {+theoretical discussion. What happens in programming?
Participant: Computer programming?
Interviewer: Yes. What kind+} of [-approximately four interviews, enough-] {+Data, Information, Knowledge flows are
there?
Participant: Do you want me+} to [-capture methodologies-] {+think+} of [-about half
the group. These interviews will be conducted alone, and will test-] {+a specific computer program
that I’ve written?
Interviewer: When you’re programming, what do you send into+} the [-effectiveness-]
{+program?
Participant: It depends if I’m writing a quick little thing to do some
analysis+} of {+Data, there’ll be something I want to do to+} the [-externally chosen topic. The last interview will use the other half of-] {+numbers, so+}
the [-group-] {+program is going to be fed some numbers,+} and
[-traditional focus group methodologies-] {+it’s going+} to [-encourage them-] {+spit
out some numbers, or print a graph or something like that. But I want+}
to [-jointly create-] {+transform those numbers in a particular way, If it’s quick like in+} an [-SDFN. By
comparing results from the control tests,-]
{+excel spreadsheet, if you’re doing a little formula,+} it [-may-] {+could+} be [-possible to understand the impact of
using focus groups when-] {+just some
Information. But I say noun 97 these numbers in this way. Sum+} it [-comes to X-Phi.

The SDFN itself will try to understand the activities of-] {+over+}
the [-group, soliciting opinions,
flows,-] {+??? something like that.

Interviewer:+} and [-discussion from all of its members. It will be vital-] {+you would say that instruction+} to [-test this methodology
in a friendly group before trying it on-] the [-research group, for I suspect there are many
different failure modes.-] {+computer is
Information?
Participant:+} The [-main area-] {+intent+} of [-interest, here,-] {+what I’m doing+} is {+Information+} to [-see-] {+it. Because
I don’t know+} how [-peoples’ answers
change when they are no longer simply discussing things with me, but rather exploring
options through-] {+it’s actually going to do it in+} the [-group.


9.5.3 Breadth-first research
Another major research track is a wide search, looking less at-] {+CPU. But I’m telling+}
the [-SDFN-] {+device... you fill out these numbers in this manner+} and [-its connection
with-] {+tell me+} the [-philosophy of data and more-]
{+numbers+} at [-how other methodologies from X-Phi,-] the [-social

sciences, and intuitive philosophy can contribute to-] {+other end.

Interviewer: Whereas a more sophisticated program, what are you
sending it?
Participant: Now, let’s say one of+} the [-philosophy-] {+models, I’ve written a Noun 2
model or something like that. I usually think+} of [-data. A great deal-] {+them as an embodiment+}
of [-work needs to be performed to build the “foundations”-] {+Knowledge. There are laws+} of {+physics and+} the [-research.

The breadth-first search would look at the three categories-] {+laws+} of [-philosophy-] {+chemistry and
all+} of [-data-] that [-I have identified-] {+that we can express as equations,+} and [-try to engage-] {+we can put+} them [-using other methodologies. Functionally,
this research is designed to test whether the different categories-] {+in in
a generic kind+} of [-data are real, what
implications they-] {+way then we+} have [-on peoples’ use of data, and how-] {+this model+} that [-interpretation of data is
communicated. It aims to be an experimental look at the nature of trading zones-] {+has our Knowledge
in there. And then we feed it numbers in+} and
[-how-] {+numbers will come out
and they’ll be transformed according to+} those [-communications influence actual work functions.

One of the primary areas-] {+laws+} of [-complementary methodological research for this is-] {+physics and+} the

[-use-]
{+laws+} of [-role-playing games-] {+noun 109+} in [-X-Phi research *. The idea of articulated roles and scenario

interactions could be an extremely valuable way of exploring philosophical problems.

In the ludic † sense, role-playing is a way to map someone’s ideas-] {+there as well.

Interviewer: Physical laws.

Participant: Yeah.


Interviewer: So you would say that... your transmission+} to [-a not-self persona.

Although it-] {+the program of physical laws+} is a [-form-] {+flow+} of [-interactive storytelling in game form, as a game-] {+Knowledge? which the program then
embodies?
Participant: No. I tell+} it {+Information.

Interviewer: You tell it Information... it then embodies...

Participant: I watch it transform, but then that Information+} is [-deeply
revealing of someone’s personal philosophies and view-] {+an embodiment+} of {+Knowledge. I know what+} the [-world because they are
engaging a fictional world with a fictional character who-] {+laws are, but the computer+} is [-emphatically not them.

Role-playing as an experimental discipline suffers from a stigma of being “just-]
{+just+} a [-game.”-] {+machine.+} It [-is my hope to use my prepared scenarios to explore how different people
understand-] {+doesn’t know that... it doesn’t know that+} the [-idea of military intelligence as data. This area-] {+law+} of [-research-]
{+gravity+} is [-also valuable
in exploring how role-playing can influence research, exploring the nature of asking
people to role-play situations where their roles have different philosophies of data. As
part of this process, different game mechanics can be explored, to see which mechanics
produce more-] {+actually+} useful [-experimental results and whether randomness and uncertainty in
*
†

Role-playing games have effectively performed-] {+for saying that things fall down+} and [-researched-] {+break. We
know that. It gets Information. I won’t even tell+} the [-art of engaging participants in scenarios for-] {+hardware. You’re
talking to+} the [-last 30 years. Sadly, little-] {+software that’s running on top+} of [-this expertise has been integrated into academia. Studying-] the
[-philosophy of data of Intelligence Agents may be an excellent way-] {+hardware. “I want
you+} to [-bridge that gap.

Play, or philosophy of play.


the mechanics increase engagement sufficiently-] {+do whatever you do+} to [-offset their decrease-] {+manipulate these numbers+} in [-experiment
reliability and reproducibility.

The main groups for-] this [-research-] {+way.”
Interviewer: So you+} would [-be various role-playing organizations,
including school clubs, table-top, role-playing gamers, and “live action” groups. Although
it is possible to engage companies with this level of research, the extreme experimental
aspect of the research suggests-] {+say+} that [-a more cooperative user-base-] {+code+} is [-preferred.

Another aspect of the breadth-first search-] {+Information.

Participant: Yes. Based on Knowledge, but it’s just Information.

Interviewer: But what you’re sending+} is [-greatly expanding the scope of my
research, while minimizing its depth. Nominally,-] {+not Knowledge, it’s Information.

Participant: That’s right.

Interviewer: You would say that+} the [-organization research of-] {+ability to make predictive assertions about+} the [-depth
section accomplishes that scope, but it still-] {+universe+} is [-primarily focused on digging deeply into
how-] {+a function of?
Participant: That’s Knowledge. That’s+} an [-organization conceptualizes data.

The other alternative is-] {+understanding of reality. So
you need+} to [-explore how diverse organizations conceptualize data.

By creating a generalized survey, longer-] {+have consciousness+} and [-tested for instructional accuracy, it becomes
possible to assess many people in many organizations in one field at the same time. This
large-scale survey would not provide the depth-] {+self-awareness and that kind+} of [-the first SDFN-based interviews,-]
{+thing. So my laptop, I don’t know about yours,+} but {+mine definitely
doesn’t have self-awareness as far as I can tell.

Interviewer: Let’s look at this. Self-awareness is a vital prerequisite
for.... sending flows of... Information and Knowledge?
Participant: Knowledge in particular.

Interviewer: Without self-awareness, Knowledge cannot be transmitted?
Participant: You can transmit+} it
[-would provide something-] {+into a book, but then that book is frozen
communication.

Interviewer: So it’s+} just {+an embodied... frozen communication+} as [-meaningful: the ability to apply statistical analysis-] {+you
said. An entity is talking+} to {+another entity via+} the [-survey results, especially with multiple choice-based demographics to complement-] {+communications
medium of a book?
Participant: That’s right.

Interviewer: So+} the [-long-form role coding-] {+book itself does not have awareness, therefore it
cannot operate upon its Knowledge. Even though it’s the vehicle for
Knowledge transmission.

Participant: That’s right.

Interviewer: So how does ... it doesn’t actually sound like you’re describing a hierarchy here in terms of Data, Information,+} and [-to test whether there are-] {+Knowledge.

Or does it? Tell me at+} any [-demographic links between-] {+point if what I’m saying is incorrect. You
would say Data are... would you say that Data is or Data are?

Participant: Data is plural. Datum is singular.

Interviewer: I’ve found+} different [-ways of thinking-] {+professions have evolved different
plurality rules.

Participant: [name]’s very demanding+} about [-the philosophy of data.

This methodology requires far more sophisticated survey design, applying multiple
disciplines’ survey-making techniques to properly “triangulate” on-] {+that.

Interviewer: So these Data are raw numbers?
Participant: Yes.

Interviewer: When you say raw numbers,+} what [-an individual
survey-taker believes. From assessments of 100-200 individuals across many organizations in the same field, patterns may emerge based on various aspects of demographic
background. These patterns would be available to-] {+do those numbers represent?
Participant: They could represent anything, they’re just numbers.

Interviewer: So+} any [-kinds of correlation analysis and
may even objectively demonstrate the various philosophies of data.

Novel research without clear prior results represents a very risky venture for most

companies. One significant obstacle to this research-] {+numbers are Data? or are some numbers not Data?
Participant: There’s some Data that’s not numbers.

Interviewer: What Data+} is [-to convince participating companies-] {+not numbers?
Participant: Qualities+} of [-its potential benefit without having research beyond this document. While
the in-depth research can investigate the requirements-] {+things.

Interviewer: So qualitative+} and [-communication habits of a
particular company, it is remarkably difficult-] {+quantitative Data?
Participant: That’s right.

Interviewer: and qualitative Data are textual?
Participant: Bigger smaller higher. It’s something that you haven’t
been able+} to [-get companies-] {+put a number to, but you think it’s important or that it’s
worth noting. It’s some... Information that you want+} to [-cooperate with their
potential competitors. One of-] {+convey. That’s
not+} the [-alternatives would be to ask-] {+right word. It’s something that you want+} to [-target-] {+convey,+} a [-company-] {+quality
about something. And so you’ll try and give it some numbers if you can,
but otherwise it’ll be qualitative.

Interviewer: Would you say+} that
[-is a holding company: this arrangement would allow for-] {+qualitative Data are Data or Information? Despite+} the [-sub-companies-] {+label?
Participant: It’s probably getting into Information then, because you
have+} to [-be interviewed across a country or state and provide a tool for-] {+know+} the [-large company-] {+context. And ways+} to [-potentially-] understand [-some of its internal data-driven disconnects.

Alternatively, this style of broad survey would be very well suited for an academic
setting, exploring how different people in many different universities perceive-] the [-nature
of data. It is also-] {+terms that are
being used. So say it’s+} a [-low-impact way to interest many academics in the discipline and the
meta-reflective questions of the philosophy of data.


9.5.4 Longitudinal research
Another research direction is temporal. Both of the above research directions stipulate
one-off studies, looking at-] {+hot day. What do you mean by that? Do you
mean you’re+} an [-organization only once. This limitation makes sense as
these studies are designed both to assess-] {+Englishman or+} an [-organization-] {+Australian when you say that? Or
an Eskimo. An Eskimo+} and {+a Hawaiian are going+} to [-assess the methodologies
assessing that organization at the same time. A third research dimension, time, can go
deep or wide as the study dictates, but the process of longitudinal research requires
minimal methodological modifications.

The essence-] {+have very different
ideas+} of [-longitudinal research is to look at changes over time. Looking at
an organization, there-] {+a hot day. So it’s Information. Context+} is [-little reason-] {+going+} to [-suppose that someone’s philosophy of data
will change much over time-] {+be something.

But if I say it’s 42 degrees Celsius, then+} except [-when their surroundings change significantly with
them. Practical philosophies-] {+for the Hawaiian everyone
else probably thinks that’s hot. But it’s actually put into a ... it’s not a
comparative ... You’ve given it in some kind+} of [-data offer ways-] {+absolute term.

Interviewer: How does Data relate+} to [-deal with constructed input from

210-] {+Information?
Participant: Data itself is even useless without+} a [-person’s environment. The old saw “If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it” applies here, as-] {+context, you need to
know what it’s about. but Information has+} a
[-working philosophy does not generate any cognitive dissonance,-] {+richer context+} and [-therefore fails to
create any impetus for change.-] {+it’s less
precise.

Interviewer:+} The [-best time to do longitudinal research on an organization-] {+maximal precision+} is in {+Data?
Participant: Yes.

Interviewer: And+} the [-process
surrounding a merger. Specifically, four studies would be optimal. The first would be
during the initial planning of the merger, when I would look at two departments that
would-] {+minimal precision is+} in [-theory be merged. The other three times, I would look at the departments after-] {+Information? Or is there
something outside on+} the [-merger had been finalized (to assist with integration),-] {+precision graph?

Participant: There’s more room for interpretation+} in [-the middle of integration,
and sometime after the dust had settled.

This investigation would investigate two primary questions: do an organization’s
philosophies of data change over time, and how does the discussion-] {+Information rather
than Data. Data is meant to give you very little room to wiggle in. It’s
meant to be precise. But then it’s precision kind+} of {+restricts its usefulness to some extent. There’s nothing hanging off+} the [-philosophy
of data inform an organization’s thoughts? At present, I do not have any ideas-] {+sides+} of [-what
could cause-] {+it.

Interviewer: SO there’s+} an [-organization’s philosophies of data to change over time, though I suspect
that changes in software use-] {+inversely proportional relationship between
precision+} and [-tools will gradually change how an organization thinks
about data.

Beyond changes in tools,-] {+scope? So we’ve got Data. Data is ...+} I [-suspect that active discussions of the philosophy of data
will indeed change how individuals in the organization-] {+don’t+} think [-about the philosophy of data.

Although-] {+we
actually have a definition there.

Participant: Data is numbers.

Interviewer: And these numbers are? What do+} they [-may not change their own, individual opinions, the explicit discussion of-] {+represent?
Participant: They could represent anything. Any time you write numbers down it’s Data.

Interviewer: So Data is merely written numbers?
Participant: Yeah.

Interviewer: These written numbers can be turned into Information?
Participant: Yeah.

Interviewer: They can be. So there’s a relationship between Data and
Information?
Participant: Yeah. There’ll be a context to interpretation.

Interviewer: So Data + context + interpretation?
Participant: Data + context is enough for Information.

Interviewer: equal Information.

Participant: Yeah.

Interviewer: What provides context?
Participant: Metadata on+} the [-practice will strongly inform how data-] {+side.

Interviewer: So metadata provides context. i.e. other Data, juxtaposed

metadata = Information?
Participant: IST may come from the thing that’s generating the Data
itself. So adding a title string to a file or something like that gives you
a context. It helps you remember+} about [-at-] {+it.

Interviewer: So there’s metadata which provides context, but there’s
nothing which attaches+} the [-organizational level.-] {+context to the Data save for the context.

Participant: Yeah,+} I
[-predict-] {+guess so.

Interviewer: Can Information become Data?
Participant: No, not really.

Interviewer: So there’s a flow that way but not+} that {+way.

Participant: I guess it could. But you have to change what you’re looking
at. Information can become Data but not when you’re talking about

the [-meta-reflection, taken from after-the-fact comments from my contacts
at BlueScope, will inform how-] {+initial thing+} the [-organization designs-] {+Data was about. You have to kind of change topics.

Looking at a different scope of things...

Interviewer: Is there a backwards ...

Participant: No, not within a system.

Interviewer: It’s+} data [-processing systems-] {++ Context becomes Information.+} and
[-communicates-] {+Information
is irreducible to Data within+} the [-nature of data.


9.6 Meta-reflection
Further research will be pursuing two primary goals: methodological improvement and

philosophical exploration-] {+confines+} of [-the philosophy-] {+a given scope.

Participant: That’s how I think+} of [-data.-] {+it, yes.

Interviewer:+} This [-research, however,-] is [-more than-] {+what I’m getting at. Can Information become anything else? Or is Information the upper bound?
Participant: In the same way that Data flows into Information when
it’s given+} a [-contribution-] {+context, the Information can become Knowledge.

Interviewer: With the addition or interaction with?
Participant: I’m trying+} to {+think about what’s+} the [-“field” of-] {+thing you have to do
to+} the [-philosophy of data, and more-] {+Information to generate Knowledge. It’s stronger+} than {+interpretation. Plus understanding?
Interviewer: Information plus understanding.... Understanding of the
Information? Is understanding+} a [-methodology. It
is-] {+function or+} a [-way-] {+separate thing?
Participant: I don’t think I kind of... a mental model is that there has to
be some kind+} of {+consciousness+} looking at [-X-Phi-] {+the Information to generate
Knowledge.

Interviewer: So you go, Information+} and [-extending that discipline-] {+understanding are arguments+}
to [-more pragmatic ends.

In many ways, this research is about applied philosophy: using philosophy-] {+consciousness?
Participant: Yes.

Interviewer: Might+} as [-an
engineer would-] {+well+} use [-science. This research-] {+familiar terminology. Consciousness,
taking in arguments of Information and understanding produces Knowledge.

Participant: It needs Knowledge. The understanding+} is [-designed-] {+actually Knowledge. So Information plus other Knowledge generates new Knowledge.

Interviewer: Can Knowledge become Information?
Participant: When you constrain it.

Interviewer: How do we want+} to [-go some distance towards
combating-] {+represent that?
Participant: It’s applied Knowledge.

Interviewer: So Knowledge + .. - maybe? What metaphor is it?
Participant: Knowledge applied to a specific situation can give Information. So, for example,+} the [-“ivory tower” [84] perception-] {+law+} of [-philosophy, especially philosophies of

technology *. The ultimate targets for this research are the practitioners who use data
every day: engineers, businesspeople, scientists, systems designers. With this research,-] {+gravity is Knowledge. And+} I [-hope-] {+apply
it+} to [-expand philosophical thinking in those areas-] {+the earth-moon system,+} and [-to demonstrate that many
worthwhile philosophical activities must be rooted in a firm knowledge of their respective
areas.

If this research can inspire another IT practitioner to explore aspects of-] the [-philosophy of technology in which they have a personal investment, then this research will have
been useful. All-] {+Information I can get is+} the [-further research directions must-] {+tides
or something like that.

Interviewer: It’s not Knowledge, it’s Information.

Participant: Yeah. So that there’s going to+} be [-focused-] {+a high tide+} in [-integrating philosophy with practice. Research that involves practitioners-] {+2 hours or
something like that, that’s Information.


Interviewer: Are there direct interactions between Data+} and [-enhances their capabilities
for meta-reflection-] {+Knowledge?
Participant: Yeah, because the Knowledge+} is [-good research. Research-] {+the law of gravity or something like that. And you’ll throw some numbers into+} that [-isolates practitioners-] and [-returns
nothing-] {+it’ll spit
out some numbers.

Interviewer: So Knowledge + Data = Data. And this new data+} is [-bad research.

This section cannot articulate all the possible research directions, for there are too
many unknown unknowns. While most-] {+what,
predictions?
Participant: Yes. So, Data + Knowledge = Data.

Interviewer: So Data + Knowledge is what kind+} of {+Data?
Participant: That’ll be Data. So Information + Knowledge will give Information. So like+} the [-known research directions are designed
around targeting or identifying flaws in the current philosophy or methodology, those
are only short-term goals. In the longer term, as-] {+earth-moon system, that’s probably more... So now
we know that there is an earth-moon system. And we’re going to apply+}
the [-rate-] {+law+} of [-change increases in-] {+gravity to apply+} the [-world,

In this chapter, I explore how the philosophy-] {+it’ll sit there
in space.

Interviewer: Are there any other directions that Data can take here?
Can Data become other things outside+} of [-data-] {+Data, Information, or Knowledge?
Participant: I+} can [-be applied-] {+make up words, but it would just come back+} to the [-philosophical
conceptions of-]
{+same idea.

Interviewer: Is Data atomic, divisible?
Participant: Well, Data, except+} the [-database-] {+plurality... I’d say it’s atomic. It’s+} as [-corporate memory. In this act of intuitive-philosophy,
I offer some evidence of a specific and concrete application of my research into the
philosophy of data-]
{+simple+} as [-contributing factor to other research.

The philosophy of data provides a novel and interesting context in which to think
about corporate databases and database design. To-] {+it gets.

Interviewer: So you can’t get below+} a [-database, data-] {+datum?
Participant: No.

Interviewer: Is Knowledge ...+} is [-an instantiation

of a sign. Just-] {+there anything that is to knowledge+} as [-words represent both signs and reality, tuples * in a database represent
signs and the reality behind those signs. When-]
{+knowledge is to Information?
Participant: No.

Interviewer: So+} we [-define data as an instantiated sign,
the nature of data in a database becomes very important. Using the communicative
definition of data, a database contains a number of signs-] {+have bounds. Data+} and [-the explicitly encoded
relationships between the tuples.

In relational databases, there exist two categories-] {+Knowledge. Nothing outside+}
of [-relationships between tuples.

The first, and simplest,-] {+the bounds.


Participant: I don’t think so. Physical reality, but I’m not sure where
you can philosophize then. Well, maybe that’s below Data. Physical
reality+} is {+reality. Real is, that’s it.

Interviewer: So therefore, we have reality on this?
Participant: Yeah, put it in. Yeah, because numbers aren’t physical
reality, numbers are numbers. They’re+} a [-grouping-] {+quantification+} of [-tuples into tables. A table exists as-] {+physical
reality. So it’s even more underlying than Data.

Interviewer: We have what applied to physical reality to get Data?
Participant: Usually+} a [-set-] {+device+} of [-identically formatted tuples purporting-] {+some kind.

Interviewer: Do we want+} to [-represent different data of similar type. The second
type of relationship between tuples-] {+say device, or+} is [-relationships between tables: while tables group
tuples together, tuples can relate-] {+device doing a verb?
Participant: OK, I’m going+} to [-each other based on internal codes or information.

The combination of these relationships allows for-] {+read+} the [-computer to encode signs as
data-] {+Noun 12+} in the [-form of tuples and to relate signs to each other, allowing for manipulation of-] {+room at+} the [-signs-] {+moment. So we get a thermometer. But it needs+} to [-create new signs,-] {+be calibrated+} and [-for information processing-] {+I
need+} to [-occur outside the brain.

In database design, the term “business rule” † defines a statement-] {+know+} that [-shapes-] {+thermometers tell me about Noun 12, so I need to
have Knowledge about+} the [-nature

A tuple is a more formal name for “row” in a database, or a set-] {+operation+} of [-data-] {+them.

Interviewer: So we have physical reality, but in order to get Data out+} of [-different domains stored together.

A business rule-]
{+physical reality,....

Participant: We’ve got physical reality, but I actually need some Knowledge to quantify physical reality.

Interviewer: The act+} is [-a constraint or action imposed upon the database by the business-] {+quantifying physical+} reality [-within which
the database is functioning.

From-] {+via Knowledge to
get Data.

Participant: Yeah.

Interviewer: But that’s+} a [-semiotic perspective, we can interpret these business rules as mental maps:
they exist-] {+one way function. And then Knowledge floats
around being Knowledge.

Participant: Yes. It’s frozen in books. And if conscious beings want+} to [-shape, form, and interpret the data through our understanding of the local-]
{+make their existence comfortable in this+} reality [-of business practices and norms. Through business rules interpreting data, the
computer can act on the data, pass new data-] {+then you’re free+} to [-other business rules, or change the
business rules themselves: the exact same relationship that a mental map has-] {+pick
it up do+} with [-signs

Interviewer: Final question. Normative assertions. When you say you
should do that, would you say that you’re passing them Data, Information, Knowledge or other?
Participant: When I say to my kids, you should do your homework, it’s
Information.

Interviewer: When you say to an position 58,+} is [-strongly informed by-] {+that Information?
Participant: How many sentences am I allowed to add at+} the [-designer’s philosophies
of data. The mapping-] {+end+} of [-relationships and-] {+it?
If I just say: “You should increase+} the [-nature-] {+blast Noun 12+} of [-each table is a reflection on both
how-] the [-designer understands data and-] {+noun 118.”
that’s Information. But they know+} how {+to do it. If they want to say why.

They’ll probably come back with “Why” or “No.” But that’s+} the [-designer understands-] {+same
thing.

Interviewer: If they come back with no,+} how [-the ultimate
users understand their data.

Designers can encode business rules in a database in two ways. First, designers can
build-] {+do you respond, do you
give+} them [-into the design-] {+a flow+} of {+Information or Knowledge or Data?
Participant: It depends on+} the [-system, informing the grouping-] {+case. I may give any one+} of [-columns,-] {+those three.

It could be Data, because I might say to+} the [-design
of tables,-] {+Noun 20+} and {+say “you should
increase+} the [-relationship of one table-] {+Noun 12” why? “because your blast is at 900 degrees.” And

it doesn’t need+} to [-another. Relationships are-] {+be said to them that that’s ridiculously low. That you
need to up it to at least 11 preferably 12 hundred degrees. So I could
give them+} a [-way-] {+piece+} of [-encoding-] {+Data and they have enough Knowledge to go, say
“Oh yeah. That’s bad.” they know that it’s in error. Or a Knowledge
situation is “I think you adjust+} the [-constraints-] {+angle+} of [-reality into a constructed simulacrum, a database. A constraint-] {+this thing by .5 degree.” and
at that point I may give Information or Knowledge according to how
much Knowledge I think they have or need. Or don’t have.

Interviewer: But the initial statement+} is {+always Information?
Participant: Well, I may talk to them about+} a
[-database’s way of enforcing-] {+Knowledge thing, I assert+}
a [-rule. A relationship between tuples is defined as: “this
tuple-] {+normative assertion, it’ll be, a you should... I may say Data, I+} may
{+say Information, but if I’m saying you should, it’s+} not [-exist without-] a [-reference to another extant tuple.” This both encodes
the specific tuple the entity being created relates to, and enforces articulation-] {+Knowledge
statement.

The other, more significant way, is with queries *: exposing-] {+project – people had different

Interviewer: So advice versus providing information. Tell me about

it’s got a high crime level, maybe I’ll choose another train. It’s a bit
opnoun 71ue, you don’t know how people made the decisions, you’re

Interviewer: When you say knowledge capture,+} is [-poorly envisioned or implemented, either because of design
errors-] {+that what you meant
by Noun 4,+} or [-misunderstanding-] {+is there a different term you mean by...

Participant: In terms+} of {+knowledge. Well,it’s funny. I use it in a different
way, but it’s probably pretty similar. When we talk about+} the [-required philosophies of data, causes multiple types

[DFD people] concepts as inputs, we refer to that – like a Noun 4 as+} data [-corruption,-]
{+as such. And Knowledge would be someone which would be putting
that+} data [-deviation, and misinterpretation. As the
system map deviates from reality, the incidence of-] {+into context. You might say: "When+} the [-three types of error named-] {+valve is+} above
[-becomes ever more likely.

Data corruption stems from where a system model does not allow or require sufficient updates from systems that observe reality. As parts of-] {+[Noun

the [-right result for the wrong reason, the user

state, turning what was an unnoticeable mistake into something that can bring the entire-] {+hierarchy. Wierdly enough I set my+}
system [-to a screeching collapse. An example of such a problem is seen-] {+up+} in [-preventative

refer+} to [-break down. These secondary systems may

Interviewer: Data as Noun 4, Knowledge as+} the [-“idiot lights” in-] {+Noun 4 stuff with context
with memories, you’d say? What do you mean by context?
Participant: You might have such as limits, there might be arbitrary
statements like: "When+} the [-dashboard, but for a bad driver, it-] {+data+} is {+trending up" It may+} not [-until-] {+even be
specific. Sometimes you might say: "When+} a [-furious boil-] {+valve is a Noun 12 above
[Noun 12] Celsius"
Interviewer: So it’s generalized statements about a Noun 4?
Participant: Yes, that’s right. That has been a reflection+} of [-smoke escapes from-] {+a compromize how we’ve set up+} the [-engine-] {+work+} that [-they are confronted with their mistake. If those
incidental problems are fixed without due thought, the underlying causes will simply
cause other systems to fail until-] {+they’re doing over+} the [-car is written off as a total loss. This unfortunate
outcome-] {+last 5 years.

Interviewer: What about information? Is it different?+} is [-purely due to the user’s system model diverging from-] {+it+} the [-car’s reality.

The second type of error is data deviation. Whereas data corruption stems from-] {+same?
Participant: In that hierarchial concept, Information sits between+} data [-falling out-]
{+and Knowledge. Again, A classic form+} of [-synchronization with reality, data deviation starts with-] {+Information that I describe
it as, it’s multi-dimensional Information. That’s+} the [-data being
out-] {+difference I draw
here too. We’re sort+} of [-synchronization due-] {+getting into multi-dimensional information as
we desribe it. You should talk+} to {+[Person X] about this as well. You
might have data versus time. It’s two dimensional, it’s+} a [-database design-] {+line. And we
like making three-dimensional graphs of things so we have this versus+}
that [-cannot accurately reflect reality.

Incorrect assumptions, norms, or ignorance-] {+versus that. you+} can [-lead to data deviation. A trivial example
is the special case of postal mail: “general delivery” that may instruct mail to go to-] {+have+} a
[-centralized post office to be held for pickup. Corporate database systems may not be
designed-] {+peak. We use a mathematical model+} to [-recognize general delivery, nor may they have business rules suitable for

have even had problems mapping other post office hacks (Postal Boxes)-]
{+generate an optimal point and you talk+} to [-geographic
location for purposes-] {+[Person X] at the university+}
of [-illness tracking [88]. These problems are data deviations, in-] {+[X] about this n-dimensional space+} which
[-reality does not conform-] {+means nothing+} to [-the database and errors occur when there-] {+me. ...

Participant: Information is really, its like... Data is something you can
work with. Information+} is an [-irreconcilable

Misinterpretation, on the other hand, stems from problems in others’ interpretation of tuples in the database. As the interfaces access the database, the system models
of the interface designers may map the meanings-] {+expression+} of the [-relationships and the tables-] {+Data+} in
[-the database incorrectly.-] {+an almost trivial

can [-create

you might get a predictive Noun 12. And that’s good, but, them, themselves, in my experience, are not actually good on their own. They need
knowledge. Someone says: "I only look at+} that [-go beyond immediate experience: Words, pictures, bodily

Does the hierarchy continue even as not+} a [-corporation’s umwelt. Although individual agents of-] {+hierearchy?

certifying officer”-] {+[company], no its not. Even when
we talk to the instrumentation guys, we still talk at that level, we don’t
go through it. You can sometimes touch on it. People sometimes allude
to it that there’s stuff there. "Well, we’ve got [number] minute data,+} and [-execute documents. MERS does-]

Participant: Well,+} the [-MERS(r) System, but rather-] {+other,+} the

are [-widespread indications

Thus, banks are using MERS as their memory; they cause it to be a model that

ways, most database-creation methodologies already expect the designer to understand

11 Conclusion
This research performed an initial exploration into-] {+[last
interview] but – we’ll have+} the [-philosophy of data. In so far-] {+Noun 1+} as [-I have shown that people have different philosophies of data and-] {+such, let’s even say it exists.

It goes wierdly through+} that {+metaphase+} it [-is possible
to probe those philosophies with my methodologies, I believe I-] {+may or may not exist. As
you’re developing it it’s sorta there there and sorta not.

Interviewer: It will+} have [-achieved my goal
of generating interest in the philosophy-] {+had existed?
Participant: Yeah, it might exist for a bit+} of [-data. This research should be sufficiently
compelling to motivate others to define the edges of “data” and, moreover, to motivate
practitioners of data-centric activities and philosophers to actually think about what
it is that they are manipulating. At the same time, claims of forming-] a [-discipline are
overrated: no one work can “form”-] {+period during+} a [-discipline, and-] {+noun 75,
then+} it [-is difficult to know in advance if
any one work will be sufficiently interesting to provide a basis for other scholars and
scientists.

This research was designed to make people question their basic assumptions-] {+disapears. But it exists now, then it continues on. Then there’s
Noun 5, we talked+} about
[-data, its nature, and their interactions-] {+Noun 5. That’s another computer system we
deal with. I’ll draw the line there, Noun 5.


Interviewer: Well, you’re the Noun 1 developer, so let’s do the nice
simple start+} with [-other peoples’ data.-] {+Noun 1.

Participant: That’s right.+} I [-wanted-] {+would stay – I have my computer system.

Participant: I send it, what I would refer+} to [-question
basic practices of data-handling techniques. By creating-] {+– as+} a [-methodology and reasons to
use that methodology, I wanted-] {+developer – I’m
encoding knowledge. I’m sending it knowledge as far as I’m concerned.

It’s not easy+} to [-prompt people and organizations-] {+try+} to [-self-reflect on
their use of data.

This self-reflection will naturally segue into communication, and may even increase
the quality of communication among different groups in-] {+express humans as+} an [-organization. If a group
recognizes that communication is impeded because of different philosophies of data-] {+if-then-else statement.

Maybe we can talk+} this
[-research may inspire a meta-dialogue that allows the group to intentionally create a
trading zone.


11.1 Results
The results-] {+as some sort+} of {+psychological session later.

Interviewer: You’re sending it knowledge...? Can we label+} this [-research are: people have different philosophies of data and my methods-] {+knowledge, or+} are [-capable of generally distinguishing between different philosophies. I have found
three distinct philosophies: data as communications, data-] {+you just...?
Participant: It’s computer code. I’m sending it computer code. It’s
knowledge expressed+} as [-subjective observations,
and data-] {+computer code, for sure. It actually sends me
back Knowledge expressed+} as [-objective facts.

over+} the [-philosophies generally consider data
to be electronically encoded semiotic representations, or bits stored on a computer.

Although some people in this category believe that data are any communications (i.e.,
data are signs), most believe-] {+years.

Interviewer: It sends back knowledge as advice?
Participant: Yeah, as textual advice. I don’t know why I make+} that [-data are re-encoded and computerized signs. This
philosophy tends-]
{+distinction., but I’ve always tried+} to [-share some space with the other philosophies in the sense that
people can use-] {+put+} the [-term “data” in an electronic sense when referring-] {+stuff it sends back, even+}
to [-“computer data”-] {+me, because I sit there+} and [-in the “proper” philosophical sense of facts or observations. However, even in-] {+read it as textual things+} that
[-case, there is more a blending-] {+sort+} of [-the two meanings rather than two distinct meanings.

There are people who classify data as observations. Observations, in this case,-] are
[-any acts-]
{+vaguely sentences I best can do+} in [-which-] {+32 characters. Its like its text, it’s
words it might have+} a [-sensor (such as the brain-] {+noun+} and [-eye) takes note-] {+it might have a verb or ...

Interviewer: Is this medium? Or is this part+} of the [-world. These
observations are then filtered according-] {+message? The text?
Participant: It’s the message?
Interviewer: I don’t see what you mean by medium there?
Participant: Is it sending the advice through text? Or is it sending text
advice through something?
Participant: It’s sending text advice through a range of different mediums. Because you can access it ... we didn’t sort of go there, how people
access it, but there is interfaces+} to [-some knowledge and situated with context as
information. All observations are data,-] {+how it goes out. And it changes a
little bit depending on the interface,+} but [-not all data-] {+there+} is [-important. Only data situated
properly-] {+sort of one interface
which I consider which they really use+} in the [-correct context can be assessed for utility.

Considering data-as-facts, people equate facts with objective, true, statements-] {+Noun 20. I sort of focus,
when I think+} about [-the world, and comprehend data as small facts-] {+it, I think+} about [-specific parts of the world.

Facts-] {+that. That’s my little box with little
words on it. Noun 11 which+} are {+bit more discriptive. I’ve actually got+} a [-superset of data, information, or knowledge, being objective and truthful
statements about the world regardless of scope. People-]
{+Noun 11 part which has a lot more stuff+} in [-this category tend-] {+it which you can do, no-one
ever uses that so it’s almost like it’s ... I don’t really support it.

Interviewer: What else do we have? So you send it code, it sends back+}
to [-favor
strongly objectivist views of science and tend-] {+you advice. What else?
Participant: I’d put Noun 5 over here, because it sends information+} to [-be scientists-]
{+the Noun 1. Data! It sends it data, for sure.

Participant:+} and [-some types of engineers.

precision, provenance, reliability, and reproducibility, among other things. Data-] {+values – it can be both real values

It is clear from the surveys that many other variations exist on these three simple
categories, and this list is in no way exhaustive, merely representative-] {+derived values such as an Noun 13 like
that. We sort+} of [-what I found-] {+draw distinctions a little bit between that.

Interviewer: So derived values as+} in
[-the majority-] {+calculation results?

Participant: Yeah. So you might calculate an Noun 13. So Noun 5
calculates some – an effiency+} of [-my interviews and surveys. It is obvious-] {+something. I take that as well as I take
raw data.

Interviewer: Do we want+} to [-me-] {+say+} that [-far more research is
necessary before any definitive statements can be made about the-] {+as a+} different [-philosophies
of data present and, especially, their possible interactions and failure modes with each
other.

Participant: Yeah we can. I certainly do derive differences between it.

Interviewer: What are we labelling this string as, these calculated results?
Participant: Derived data, we refer to them as. So it would be "Data,
derived." As much+} as [-an X-Phi methodology. The SDFN,
inspired by the-] {+these are+} data [-flow diagram methodology-] {+like real ...

Interviewer: what else?
Participant: Out+} of [-systems design,-] {+here... My next primary focus+} is [-quite able-] {+Noun 14.

Interviewer: What are they talking to?
Participant: They’ll be talking+} to [-cause
participants-] {+the Noun 1 and+} to [-differentiate between practical definitions-] {+Noun 5,+} and [-theoretical definitions
when discussing the philosophy-] {+to a few
other+} of [-data.

The SDFN produced many useful discussions-] {+these guys as well. This is sort+} of [-data, causing participants-] {+getting complicated already.

Interviewer: you have no idea. And tell me about this?
Participant: We’re sending, Noun 1 is sending text advice as knowledge
to those guys –+} to [-reflect
on-] their [-own working definitions-] {+Position 8.

Interviewer:+} and [-on how they contrast with formal or intuitive

iterative categorization of the SDFN. This process of iterative categorization provides

Participant: we’ve got to put+} the [-analysis of-] {+Noun 2 here. It doesn’t make any
sense without having a Noun 2 here, because they have to send stuff to+}
the [-transcript and-] {+Noun 2. So that’s an object.

Participant: I’m going to put+} the [-analysis of-] {+Noun 2 in+} the [-diagrams suggests that-] {+corner which may be
very limiting in a way by cornering it like that.

Interviewer: we’ve got those little star escapes
Participant: oh, those little stars.

Participant: So it’s sending – those guys send back data in+} the [-generation-] {+form+} of [-the SDFN diagrams provides-]
{+set points. So they’ll want to change+} a [-useful triangulation method for both reflection during the interview and subsequent
analysis. However, the SDFN requires significant refinement: it must be made less intimidating; steps must be made-] {+valve position, say valve 7+} to [-make analysis easier;-] {+45...+}
it [-needs-] {+will want+} to [-be codified such that
other people can perform both the collection and analysis stages of the SDFN.

The survey, though currently able-] {+return stuff+} to [-generate surprising results, presents signif-

icant difficulty in assessing utility.-] {+them.

Interviewer: it will or will not?
Participant:+} It [-does not provide-] {+may or may not.

Interviewer: is it relevant?
Participant: no. We can say here that this is a really good line... these
guys send... it sends data and we term+} as [-rich an experience-] {+real values. it also sends data+}
as [-the
interviews and SDFN. Furthermore, its execution presents significant problems in both instructions and scenario content. Quite a lot of effort will be needed to bring the scenariobased survey up-] {+calculated values. These guys send, really they send stuff I refer+} to
{+data as derived values back into Noun 5. Which is a bit weird. It actually
was super important because these guys have a value they operate+} the [-level of-]
{+Noun 2 by.

... Participant: ... They will sit there, they’ll do calculations on+} a [-polished X-Phi methodology.


11.2 Methodological conclusions
The interviews via SDFN and surveys were successful. The bubble diagrams were useful
in extracting philosophies and produced good discussion. My chosen research group,-] {+computer. they’ll get some – they get a reading from+} the [-fine engineers, scientists,-] {+Noun 15+} and [-researchers at BlueScope Steel, were-] {+they
calculate+} a [-fantastic initial
target. My original intent was simply-] {+derived value which they’ll operate. This is a new derived
value we’ve got+} to [-interview intelligent agents, but this group
proved-] {+operate

Interviewer: so do they send data+} to [-be far more valuable for my research at this juncture.

The subject matter being explored was no less difficult and presented its own edge
cases. Specifically,-] {+themselves?
Participant: Wierdly enough, a key part of+} the [-group presented-] {+project early on. They
have+} a [-number-] {+whole heap+} of [-different trading zones as scientists
and engineers interacted-] {+information – I feel like I’m+} in {+front of+} a [-highly competitive area. The research-] {+barrister, with the terminology. These guys send information back – these
guys have information which they didn’t used to send to Noun 5, but
I needed it over here because I+} was [-both practical
and theoretical and had-] {+telling them+} to [-show progress on both fronts, creating many different goals
and many different research languages.

At the same time, the methodology involved far less paperwork and far fewer nonresearch security concerns. The utility-] {+do something, but
they said "well dude, it changed." but I said "I don’t know about it." so
I went through a noun 97 with them entering+} derived [-from-] {+data back into+}

there was definitly+} a [-local facility

devices, nor publishing constraints cannot-] {+loop there. There used to+} be [-overstated. I could focus on the difficult aspects-] {+a bit+} of [-the research rather than on the difficult aspects-] {+a disconnect,
because it was mostly data coming here, data going there. These guys
would just spin around themselves....

Participant: Let’s call that Noun 16? they only noun 97 Noun 17, I can
give you an example+} of {+one. It might be nice for your thesis
Interviewer: I would love artefacts. ...

Participant: Yeah. They will send derived data back to+} the [-bureaucracy surrounding
the research.

The informal atmosphere-] {+daily noun
97 Noun 17. They’ll+} also [-presented significant advantages. My interactions
with the team allowed for-] {+send data as real values as well. But that’s+} a [-sense of reassuring informality in the interviews while the
non-interview interactions (mainly sharing meals) allowed for-]
{+dead end. That’s+} a [-sense of rapport that

helped the difficult sections-] {+sheet+} of {+paper. Previously, there wasn’t this link, it
didn’t exist before...

Interviewer: this link being+} the [-interviews slide past. This informality allowed people-] {+Noun 14+} to [-communicate their insights without worries-] {+Noun 5 dervied data? You
but+} that {+link in so you could reverse position 58+} what they were [-going to say would
backfire.

The survey in practical matters was a partial success. Although-] {+doing...

Participant: Yes
Interviewer: How does+} the [-second survey

derived data? And so, Noun 5 also sends it real values... where is it
getting+} the [-thoughts of-] {+real values from?
Participant: From Noun 5 as well.

Interviewer: Where is Noun 5 getting+} the [-participants, a number of people thought-] {+real values?
Participant: That’s why we needed+} the [-survey had a different intent,-] {+Noun 2 in here, because the
Noun 2 obviously is doing stuff+} and [-thus their answers presumed different questions
than those I asked.-] {+it’s sending real values. The Noun
2 doesn’t really calucate anything. It sorta does it sorta doesn’t.+} As [-such, the wording-]
{+far as I’m concerned it doesn’t. But it has real values, that’s just Noun
4, composition+} and [-the scenarios could be tightened. All-] things [-considered, however,-] {+like that. And it will send that real values –
it’s wierd, it’s where you sit. Now we’re talking about+} the [-survey’s results are acceptable for use, but could stand
quite a lot-] {+philosophy+}
of [-work to improve their reproducibility-] {+data, where you sit+} and [-accuracy. Nonetheless,-] {+things, because – you’re right, you can pin
me down and say well: "Why when it calculates+} the
[-survey presented-] {+top down composition that I see that as real value data when it’s not really if you think
about it, because it’s a instrument that’s measuring atomic percents

philosophy of data.

And ovbiously, percentage+} is [-science to do and research to be done-] {+not a real value+} in [-the philosophy of data. This
dissertation merely paints the broadest outlines of possible questions to ask. The philosophy-] {+terms+} of [-data offers many ideas-] {+what that is,
but+} to [-many disciplines,-] {+me,+} and [-borrows just-] as [-many. In-] {+you flow through+} the
[-discussion-] {+chain+} of [-“what is data?”, there is no a consensus on an answer, and investigating
that definition and the trading zones constructed around-] {+data,+} it [-will pose the majority of the
work for the next few research projects. Linking the philosophy-] {+transforms.

of science and the philosophy-] {+ontology. Well its not really, if you pin me down, maybe it’s not. But it
sort+} of [-technology through intuitive connections-] is [-useful.

This link offers pragmatic and useful advice distilled-] {+to me. It’s percentage. Well, it’s not real, but it becomes real.

It’s a pinnochio thing. They want to be a real boy. Eventually, after

that’s real, measurable, and people love it. You look at its source, and
often we have these problems. If you look at+} the [-philosophy-] {+source, the source may
not actually maintain the love+} of [-data-] {+over here, but, as you stretch out+} and
{+try to transform people’s opinion of it changes. It does sort of – it+} can
be [-useful in exploring other philosophies.

The SDFN is-] {+loved, but if you have+} a [-definition- or operationalization-discovery tool-] {+look at it,+} and [-can be profitably used
in explorations of experimental moral philosophy.


One major research direction for-] {+say no, "that machine broke
ten years ago. Why are you still looking at+} the [-philosophy of data is to define-] {+value?" and they say
"Well, we love that. That’s+} a [-set of open
questions of the philosophy, questions that will guide researchers into more specific areas

Participant: That’s right. It becomes a+} something that [-will allow
cooperation and mutual work without much unnecessary duplication of effort.

The results must be accessible.-] {+we can use.+} It [-is far too easy-]
{+comes back+} to [-scream, “This was-] {+data as an object or as+} a [-triumph,”

which+} is [-articulated by Eliezer Yudkowsky:
“Well, sounding wise wasn’t difficult. It was a lot easier than being intelligent, actually,

[-reduced to pattern-matching Deep Wisdom without any pragmatic export or falsification
of results,-] {+wierdly explicit but not discrete.

Interviewer: wait, what is explicit but not discrete?
Participant: Knowledge. I’m being probably a bit loose in my terminology. But its like – Knowledge is explicit because+} I [-will have failed.

People-] have [-different philosophies of data. They can think of data as stored signs
of communications, data as subjective observations of-] {+to, in+} the [-world, or data-] {+Noun

Welcome, and thank-] you [-for choosing-] {+besides that textual analysis?
Participant: As a Noun 1 developer? Well, yeah... I’d draw that one in,

the [-ethics secretariat. If you have any questions or comments about-] the [-questions below, please contact brianb@student.unsw.edu.au
This survey is completely anonymous and we ask that participants not take it multiple times.

The survey software will allow you to resume later by creating a login-] {+Noun 1 developer. That line between Noun 5+} and [-password. Please do not use an identifiable
user name for this. While it is impossible to associate your username with-] the [-survey,-] {+Noun 1
developer – this is where it’s complex,+} it is [-also useful to not-] {+there because, as part of the
Noun 1 developer, I’m interpreting.

[-identify-]
{+just do all+} the [-username.-] {+trivial bits and see what’s left.

Participant:+} At [-any time you may choose to exit-] {+the moment, there’s almost – there’s a data flow diagram

This survey-]
{+talking to me which+} is [-exploring what you think about Data. To do that,-] the [-survey will present-] {+Noun 14s to Noun 1 developers. But maybe
we’re getting ahead of myself. Because we haven’t quite – this sort of

DFD that we’ve got here with Noun 1 developer, Noun 5, Noun 14, Noun
16, Noun 2 is describing+} a [-list-] {+bit+} of [-short "scenarios". We will
ask you to categorize-] the [-scenario-] {+– maybe a different problem that
we started off with. Maybe we can label this one+} as [-involving Data, Information, Knowledge, or something else, depending on your own
understanding-] {+"Noun 2 operation
optimization" which is really the purpose+} of the [-terms.

We believe that people can have-] {+project and it’s above.

And it’s ovbiously+} different [-philosophies, depending-] {+from developing the Noun 1. Ovbiously,
we’ll find similar things. Maybe it’s hard to find where to draw the
lines.

Interviewer: do we need a line there?
Participant: I’d just take the line out between Noun 5 and Noun 1 for
the time being. Depending+} on {+the context, I guess. In Noun 2 operation
optimization, I’d just..

Interviewer: in that domain, are there any other flows?
Participant: That’s+} what [-job they're doing. For-] {+I’m trying... maybe I can get a photocopy of+}
this [-survey-] {+and go again? And+} we [-ask-] {+have+} that
[-you think about the scenarios from-] {+and we have Noun 5 and+} the [-perspective of one of your jobs.


1 This survey-] {+Noun
2+} has [-requested that you answer-] {+Noun 5 data and we send+} it [-from the perspective of one of-] {+to+} the [-jobs that-] {+guys. And here+} you [-do. Please describe the duties-] {+have more
– we left out a lot+} of {+circles here+} that [-job (in general).

Please write your answer here:

For example, I could answer "I'll be answering-] {+we really should fill in. And we’ll
just stick to the Noun 2 operation optimization which is different from

interesting,+} and [-tries to figure out what they do."

Scenario 1
I am trying to understand what-] {+it’s something interesting – if we can get+} you [-think-] {+in the
Noun 20. No promises there. If we can get you over that hurdle? This is
sort+} of [-as Data,-] {+like their experience+} and [-why.

The questions below ask you-] {+how I interact with those guys. It would
be good+} to [-categorize the scenario, and then explain the categorization.

Please read-] {+do Noun 1 rule noun 129 because that’s how I interact with+}

Then please, in a sentence or two, explain why you categorized the scenario as you did.

9.

Interviewer: these guys being?
Participant: The Noun 14s
Participant: The Noun 14 and Noun 9 often interchange roles. But

{+Noun 9 is away,+} the [-highlighted word or phrase-] {+Noun 14 has to step into his role+} in [-context-] {+terms+} of [-the scenario.

Alice receives-] {+Noun 2
operation. They send each other – this is really+} a [-letter from Bob containing instructions on how-] {+tough one. They talk+}
to [-build-] {+each other. So I’d describe it as they do literally talk to each other. It’s

4 Please categorize-] {+go at trying to capture verbal feedback

systems blithely – because they get a phone call "Yeah, something’s

make this change." Just lost, it’s out there and thing. People have sorta
become accepting+} of the [-following:

issue. It’s a really strong data flow I guess that I’m talking to... So they
talk to each other.


Interviewer: is this talk: Data, Information,+} Knowledge
[-Other
Please be-] {+or just talk?
Participant: I’d describe it+} as [-precise-] {+just ... there are a couple of different
levels, but let’s say on an operation optimization ... I’d describe it+} as [-you desire. If something-]
{+Information. But they can actually. But no, no, it’s true. We can put

You-] {+really they transmit Knowledge. I can call that
experience. And that’s absolutely true. They transmit experience in
this direction sort of going out into there and often these guys [Noun
14]+} are [-welcome-] {+younger guys without a high degree. Maybe they haven’t been+}
to [-use the "Other" choice-] {+uni. And [Noun 9] will be telling them experience and how+} to [-describe-] {+do+} it [-more exactly. Perhaps it's completely different like

these are. I don’t know how we can... maybe I can give it [the data
flow] an AA. They’re almost duplicate lines, but I’d like to acknowledge
them+} as [-something else"

5 Please explain in one or-] {+they’re different. Because there are+} two [-sentences why you categorized-] {+people in+} the [-scenario

different {+not+} from [-the other-] {+my experience. But for your purposes, I’m copying+}
things [-you categorized, "Data as something" or
"Information-] {+now, like the Noun 1 provides the same knowledge by text advice
to these guys+} as [-something else"

7 Please explain in one or two sentences why-] {+it does to them.

Participant: And similiarly,+} you [-categorized-] {+know, a lot of these flows where they’re

that way.

Please write your answer here:

Scenario 4
Please read-] {+Noun 14 are+} the [-following one sentence scenario. Categorize-] {+same as between Noun 5 and these

[-Please write-] {+The guy doesn’t sit there and say "ohh, I’m
going to make this change without+} your [-answer here:

INTRODUCTION

Many people believe that data-] {+analysis goes on.

Interviewer: Do you know or care about the instrumentation they use
for analysis or verb 73? Or+} is {+it just+} a [-technological construct,
that we encode information and knowledge inside data when
interacting-] {+blackbox thing?
Participant: We do care. In part, that’s covered+} in [-electronic systems. Other people believe that data
are-] the [-basis of science: hard numbers as-] {+noun 42. Is+} the [-product-]
{+question about: do we care about what sort+} of
[-experiments. That data must be objective, reproducible, with-] {+instrument they are
using or+} the [-limits-] {+type+} of [-precision known. Still other people believe-] {+tests+} that
[-data-] {+they+} are [-an observation of some kind. That data-] {+doing?
Interviewer: Both. Because. We+} can [-be
qualitative or quantitative, so long as it is a recorded
observation. People may use data in the singular or plural, not-] {+treat this+} as a [-grammatical error, but-] {+black box. And stuff
will flow from this black box to these. Or we can treat this+} as [-a reflection-] {+part+} of [-how-]
{+your understanding of the project, at which point we’re going to label
their external manipulations of your noun 37 according to the SOP.

Participant: I’ll explore+} one
[-understands this ultimately socially constructed concept.

These beliefs-] {+area. So these+} are [-incommensurate and largely
incompatible.-] {+physical noun 37.+} They [-influence thought, analysis,-]
{+actually have to manipulate those physical noun 37. They actually
have to take+} and [-selfreflection,-] {+crush those noun 37+} and {+prepare the physical noun
37. These+} are [-strongly influenced by someone’s
background and workplace.-] {+phsyical noun 37 from our noun 60...+} In [-studying these different
philosophies of data, held by people who work with data every
day, I found it difficult-] {+order for the
experimental team+} to [-ignore my own philosophy of data.

To state a philosophy by fiat destroys any possible evidence for
multiple philosophies. For that reason, it seems better-] {+do their experiments, they need+} to [-set
aside one’s own philosophy of data-] {+actually do
some further ...+} and [-use-] {+classification of+} the [-techniques and
research results described below to question-] {+noun 37. The way they do+} that [-philosophy.

This paper explores my experimental research into-]
{+depends on+} the
[-philosophy of data. My research has two goals: to create-] {+noun 42.

Interviewer: So, is there an entity – some technological device that is+} a
[-methodology to probe-]
{+useful catch-all or a useful...

Participant: Let’s call it a properly sized Noun 21 noun 37
Interviewer: So they’re sending properly sized Noun 21 noun 37?
Participant: No. They recieve+} the [-philosophy of data for practical use,
and to see if people really do-] {+physical noun 37, then they+} have [-different philosophies of
data.

The research had two primary goals, phrased as statements
of interest-] to [-guide the abductive process of rapid hypothesis

JUSTIFICATION OF RESEARCH

Creating a philosophical basis for data requires significant
justification. Information Technology (IT) researchers tend-]
{+generate this properly sized Noun 21 noun 37. So they have+} to
[-spend-] {+do some
crushing and sizing.

Interviewer: So this would be+} a [-great deal of time-] {+noun 44? So this goes physical noun 37
in,+} and [-effort chasing after quite
worthwhile new technologies without considering the
philosophical implications of those technologies [1]. IT
practitioners must serve as an interface between computing-] {+out comes properly sized+} and
[-people. They must understand what people actually want-] {+crushed... where does that go?
Participant: It goes into an experimental noun 45. Crushed+} and
[-must understand-] {+sized
Noun 21.

Interviewer: Are there any stuff flows, Information, Data, going along
this route?
Participant: No, because it’s being done by this group.

Interviewer: So they’re not setting any settings on+} the [-reality from which-] {+noun 44.

Participant: Yes+} they [-desire that thing. If
IT people cannot understand-] {+are. That setting will be done to be consistent
with+} the [-needs-] {+noun 42 that’s been provided.

Interviewer: Are they setting the setting? Here’s the tricky bit. That
setting+} of the [-users and-] {+setting, i.e.+} the
[-reality that they live in, they cannot do their jobs. However, if
they cannot then understand-] {+transmission of+} the [-philosophies encoded-] {+settings+} into
[-programs via-] the [-many socially constructed protocols-]
{+machine, is+} that [-a
computer requires to-] {+Information or is that Data? Or is that something else?
Participant: Well, it’s data from us, but it’s Information into this machine, isn’t it? We tell them – this was Information... Information can+}
be [-useful, they cannot understand-] {+Data as well, right? You don’t want so say?
Interviewer: The thing is, I can’t tell you+} what
[-problems-] {+you think.


Participant: The noun 42 has Data on the size distribution. So that’s+} a [-computer system thinks it solves.

An understanding of-]
{+set size distribution. So that’s Data that we’ve provided+} the [-philosophy of data is not merely an
academic question. Siloing-] {+people so
that they’re informed so as to how to set.

Interviewer: So,+} in [-organizations,-] the [-practice of
small groups talking mostly amongst themselves [2], may be
partly due to different understandings-] {+Information+} of the [-nature-] {+noun 42, which is compiled+}
of [-data.

Imagine someone with-] {+multiple protocols
Participant: this is+} one of [-the other philosophies described
above talking to “a busy expert” about what he or she thinks
the needs-] {+them
Interviewer: This is one+} of [-a system should be. Without an awareness-] {+them, and you would say this invididual
protocol is Data? So in this packet+} of {+Information it goes through+} the
[-different definitions of data,-]
{+position 41,+} the [-amount of effort needed to
create a linguistic trading zone-] {+position 41 adds SOP,+} and [-actually communicate with
this person about their infological needs is far more effort than
a simple dismissal.

Exploring the philosophy of data-] {+that packet plus SOP+} is [-a gateway question. I
seek-] {+still
Information. Do they perform something interesting+} to [-help IT practitioners-] {+this packet+} to [-accurately model clients’ views
of reality,-]
{+extract out – or can it even be extracted out – the settings for this noun
44?
Participant: No, they just take Information+} and [-then to entice them into other philosophical
thoughts. The difficulty of modeling is-] {+make the setting.

Interviewer: So+} that {+would be transmitting information of size settings.

– Now, they’ve got an experimental noun 45. How are they interacting
with+} the [-client seldom
explicitly states their understanding-] {+noun 45?
Participant: They’re running the noun 45.

Interviewer: Are they transmitting stuff to the noun 45? or is it
Participant: Are they transmitting stuff?
Interviewer: Are they transmitting components+} of [-reality. By building
tools-] {+the tech plan+} to [-probe those models, this experimental philosophy-] {+the
noun 45?
Participant: No, because that’s what the SOP+} is
[-both a vehicle for discovery and something that allows us-] {+about. The SOP guides
them as+} to
[-start feeling our way-] {+how they should run that noun 45.

Interviewer: So there’s no data flow or Information flow+} into the [-philosophy of IT.

PHILOSOPHICAL LITERATURE

A dominant philosophical theme in my research is-] {+noun
45.

Participant: No.

Interviewer: What happens from+} the
[-concept-] {+noun 45?
Participant: Produce new noun 37+} of [-a trading zone: two groups, not sharing a common

language, come-] {+noun 46 which need+} to [-a place where they can evolve a locally
functional language [3].-] {+be analyzed.+}
It [-is-] {+goes to+} a [-way-] {+Laboratory.

Interviewer: And we’ve got new noun 37+} of [-communicating concepts
between two groups without forcing either group to change
what they know-] {+noun 46+} to [-be true. Both groups understand that-] the
[-language is only locally true, not globally so. Trading zones
between groups in an organization come-] {+lab: Who
follow standard procedures as transmitted+} from [-creating an
evaluative accent to understand the other group’s jargon.

Volosinov describes the theory behind an evaluative accent
thusly: “Any word used in actual speech possesses not only
theme and meaning in the referential,-] {+him+} or [-content, sense of-] {+them?
Participant: Probably by him.

Interviewer: So we’ve got SOP. And+} these
[-words, but also value judgment: i.e. all referential contents
produced in living speech are said or written in conjunction
with a specific evaluative accent” [4]. Differences in this
evaluative accent-] {+SOP+} are [-very acute when it comes-] {+Knowledge, Information...

Participant: Also, according+} to the [-signifier
“data” and that people apply their own evaluative accents based
on their current job.

Combine trading zones with learned evaluative accents and
we can see the roles of the philosopher and the IT practitioner.-] {+noun 42
Interviewer: but it’s not that? Is it this flow?
Participant:+} In the [-trading zone necessitated by two different evaluative
accents of “data”, my research participants coined terms for
locally true definitions. They used the term “Raw Data”-] {+noun 42, there is Information as+} to
[-mean readings directly taken from sensors, and the term
“Derived Data”-] {+what lab tests are+}
to [-mean calculations on those readings
performed automatically. They used these terms even if they
had different philosophies of data. The terms were part-] {+be done. It’s like that. You could take it out+} of [-a
local language.-] {+there if you wanted
to?
Interviewer: What reflects reality best?

Participant:+} The [-participants who were not part of the group
however, did not use those terms.

This sub-discipline of-] {+reality is that it probably... as well as SOP, it would be
noun 42. In fact, it’s a bit similiar to what you’ve got there. noun 42
conducted...

Interviewer: Is+} the [-philosophy of data does not seek-] {+noun 42 conducted also Information when it’s sent
over here? So noun 42 conducted according to SOP goes+} to [-have-] the [-same explanatory power of-] {+lab along
with noun 46 noun 37 which have been prepared through all that. What
happens then?
Participant: Then Data from+} the [-Philosophy of
Information. Floridi-] {+lab comes back through to this person
here.

Interviewer: So this+} is [-investigating the philosophy of
information from a traditional intuitive stance [5]. He-] {+Data. What is this Data?
Participant: The Data+} is
[-exploring deep questions of-] the [-universal nature-] {+results+} of [-information,
computation and AI. The philosophy-] {+laboratory testing+} of [-data should have-] {+noun 46
noun 37. I’m being Generic, if that helps you. I could be+} more
[-practical breadth than-] {+specific
about what exactly+} the [-philosophy of Information’s
theoretical focus because data is-] {+Data is, – I’m happy to do that.

Interviewer: I would love an artifact... like+} a [-socially constructed
understanding that predates and is broader than modern
technological usage. We are asking questions-] {+verb 73+} of [-how people
perceive reality without exploring-] the [-deep questions of
whether or not-] {+results? But
unless you think+} that [-perception is fundamentally true.

The most difficult and most vital component of any IT
project-] {+it explains what you think Data+} is {+more, I don’t
think we need+} to [-understand the clients’ realities. Many techniques
have been found to probe these foreign understandings of-] {+go into any more detail.

Participant: I think+} the
[-world. User interface and database design practices heavily
informed my methodology. One user-centered design [6]
practice that inspired this research-] {+emphasis+} is [-Joint Application Design.

It-] {+that it+} is a [-method of gathering all the stakeholders in a room,
enticing them to state their wants, and hoping they come to a
compromise [7]. Philosophically speaking, a Joint Application
Design (JAD) highlights the local languages between groups
for the developers of the system. Through the stakeholders’
conflict, the developers can start to gain multiple viewpoints
into how-] {+result from+} the [-groups actually use-] {+test.

Interviewer: Because that’s+} the [-terms and what they
actually want as described-] {+second time you’ve used Data+} in [-their own reality. My intuition of
the JAD’s ability to discover local languages was one of the
prompting points of the decision to use-] {+this,
which is why it is significant.

Participant: So this person prepares reports, and then+} the [-tools of information
technology-] {+reports come
back+} to [-discover the philosophical background of-] the
[-subjects.


The study of-] {+position 32.

Interviewer: so you get reports on+} the [-philosophy of data-] {+results
Participant: Correct. Via e-mail.

Interviewer:+} is [-multidisciplinary.

The techniques-] {+this significant?
Participant: No.

Interviewer: It’s interesting. Some people would say+} that [-information technologists use to probe-] {+e-mail is
significant and that it actually changes+} the
[-realities of their clients can also be applied by philosophers to-] {+way+} the [-domain of-] {+other people go –it’s
e-mail. So reports on lab results. Is this Data+} Information [-Technology itself. These techniques-] {+Knowledge,
other?
Participant: At that point it’s Data. They+} are [-useful for the purpose of experimental philosophy.

Experimental philosophy, instead of relying on the intuitions of
philosophers, seeks to find validation [8] (or falsification [9],
exploring paradigms [10], or refining research programmes
[11], whatever works [12], etc…)-] {+providing us Data. They
haven’t made any – Even+} in [-the expressed
understandings-] {+context+} of {+comparing+} other [-people. This objective synchronizes
extremely well-] {+results, they
would have compared Data from previous experiments that they’ve
done+} with {+ours.

Interviewer: And are these comparisons also Data, or are they priviledged in some way?
Participant: I would have thought that would have been Information
which they are not privy to declosing to us anyway. As far as I’m concerned... we get+} the [-techniques of IT.-] Data [-modelers-] {+back.

Interviewer: Are there any other entities or steps we haven’t described?
Participant: Here there’s another one. Then we+} have [-long used-] {+the discussion
internally, with position 39. Obviously, we each, individually analyze

208+}

the data [-flow-] {+ourselves and then we do an excel spreadsheet analysis, if you
want.

Interviewer: Let’s stop there, let’s diagram that. How can we+} diagram [-(DFD)-]
{+that? We’ve got this line going+} to [-model the processes of interaction in organizations [13]. My
research appropriated-] the [-technique-] {+position 39, what’s this first – do
you perform any operations on these reports before sending them+} to [-probe an individual’s
understanding of data flows. As the computing industry moved
away from structured programming,-]
the [-role of the DFD ceased-] {+position 39?
Participant: I do. I will probably summarize key points in an excel
spreadsheet. Differences between successive tests.

Interviewer: What do we want+} to [-be a programming tool. Instead, it became a workflow
visualization tool. The DFD now-] {+label that, and+} is [-used to build a consensus
reality of all-] {+that Data as well?
Participant: It’s certainly data. “Results Analysis” Summary, I guess,+}
of [-the data manipulations present in the client’s
workplace. In my philosophical work,-] {+results analysis – Results Summary.+} I [-re-appropriate the
technique and use it to probe an individual’s constructed
reality.-] {+guess+} I [-used the technique to cause the subject of-] {+use+} the
[-interview to make rapid classifications of many different flows
of data, information,-] {+word Analysis
there as well. ...+} and [-knowledge. Thus, the re-reappropriated DFD forms the cornerstone-] {+Analysis.

Interviewer: Then what happens?
Participant: Then we have our discussion.

Interviewer: How can we represent this discussion? Should we represent this discussion?
Participant: No. There’s all sorts+} of [-my methodology.

IV.


METHODOLOGY

My work involved two distinct methodologies. The primary
exploration technique used a new technique called a Social
Data Flow Network, iteratively developed throughout an
interview,-] {+discussions going on elsewhere as
well, but we haven’t presented that necessarily. You can leave it+} as {+that.

And then, there’s+} a [-way-] {+bit+} of [-extracting a participant’s philosophy-] {+recycle loop. This whole noun 97 then out+} of
[-data. Due to unusual interest, however, a survey protocol was
developed to complement the interview by probing a larger
audience through the internet.

A. Interview Methodology
When probing-]
{+discussion are conclusions based on+} the [-philosophy of data of a relative stranger,
two important tasks must be accomplished before engaging in
any kind-] {+current set+} of [-theoretical discussion. The participant must be
willing to talk-] {+results+} and [-the participant must uncover his or her own
actual understanding of data. Only-] then [-can-]
we [-actually ask the
participant to define data. If the definition stage occurs too
early,-] {+may well review+} the [-participant tends-] {+noun 42 and start this all again.

Interviewer: So they send conclusions+} to [-fall back on dictionary definitions
that-] {+you?
Participant: No no.

Interviewer: you all generate conclusions
Participant: Yeah.

Interviewer: How+} do [-not echo their true understanding, because the
definitions are so divorced from normal practice.

Interviews-] {+we want+} to [-probe the philosophy of data occur in three
parts. The first component-] {+represent these conclusions, or do we?
Or+} is that [-of-] {+stream+} the [-introduction and
demographics. Following that, we move to-] {+conclusions, from+} the [-Social Data
Flow Network creation. Then-] {+earlier iteration?
Participant: Yeah, that’s fine. This was specific to the noun 42.

Interviewer: So+} we [-conclude with a theoretical-] {+add another stream going here...

Participant: well, if you want, you can leave it as it is, then this+} discussion. The [-introduction-] {+entity is that the position 39 – the position 39+} and [-demographic section-] {+myself get
together – therefore that stream ....

Interviewer: so we have position 32 sends position 39 and position 32 a
stream of Data which+} is [-vital.-] {+results summary and analysis.

Participant: Therefore, we can go from here with an updated noun 42.

From then on we can follow the loop.

Interviewer: And the updated noun 42 is?
Participant: It’s Data, Sorry it’s Information. I mean,+} It [-serves-] {+is both, right?
I’m providing data, but it’s primarily information.

Interviewer: Unpack that for me.


Participant: So I’m providing numbers. So the numbers, in isolation,
mean virtually nothing. So attached+} to [-break-] the [-ice. Participants usually are quite nervous-] {+data is some Information.

Particularly+} in [-these
interviews-] {+this feedback loop, I would present, we said we were
going to crush the Noun 21s to this specification, but based on the
current results, we’ll change it, so here’s a new setting which we still
refer to+} as [-there-] {+Information anyway.

Interviewer:+} is [-a sense-] that [-“strong academic rigor” will
be required of-] {+correct?
Participant: I think so. In making that judgement, or in providing that
Data, we are informing+} them [-because-] of {+why we are changing+} the [-word: “Philosophy.” By
allowing participants to talk safely about their background,-] {+specifications,
changing that Data.

Interviewer: In+} a
[-number of important interview goals are fulfilled. Their
discussion highlights an important facet-] {+sense, this size setting is composed+} of [-their work that will
serve-] {+numbers plus
... explanation?
Participant: Almost Intellectual Property, some explanation.

Interviewer: IP is a good word. We’ve got numbers plus IP. And you’d
describe the numbers as?
Participant: As the data.

Interviewer: And you’d describe the IP+} as the [-basis-] {+Information. And that
entire packet+} of [-the Social Data Flow Network. It-] {+data + Information, of numbers + IP, that entire packet
is+} also

[-provides-] {+Information.

Interviewer: Where does Knowledge happen, is there any Knowledge
transmission in this whole noun 97?
Participant: Yeah. The Knowledge transmission probably takes place
in this discussion.

Interviewer: in+} the [-normal comforting elements-] {+discussion+} of [-an icebreaking
question [14].

The second stage begins when-] the [-participant is
comfortable in-] {+position 39 and+} the [-interview. This stage is-] {+position 32,
what – where’s+} the [-creation-] {+Knowledge interaction there?
Participant: Where is it, or how does it...?
Interviewer: All+} of the
[-Social Data Flow Network,-] {+above.

Participant: So it’s+} a [-term created to differentiate-] {+meaning??? Data’s on+} the
[-diagram from-] {+table. Information is
exchanged: what do I know, what do you know? What does+} the [-typical Data Flow Diagram and ultimately
ignored for-] {+Data,
what do+} the [-practical term bubble diagram. The process-] {+results mean?
Interviewer: And that meaning+} of
[-creating the bubble diagram starts with a very short description-] {+results is... Information?
Participant: The meaning+} of [-an entity. An entity, in these terms,-] {+results+} is [-any person or thing-] {+Information. But,+} that [-can take in, manipulate, or transmit data, information, or
knowledge. This definition marks-] {+Information may be new. Or that’s an unexpected result. There is potential for
Knowledge, for new Knowledge to be generated.

Interviewer: And+} the [-first major departure-] {+new Knowledge which is generated comes+} from
{+Participant: From+} the [-DFD. As the ultimate goal-] {+analysis+} of [-this process is to force-] the [-participants to categorize data, information,-] {+results+} and [-knowledge
flows,-] the [-rigor-] {+discussion+} of the [-normal DFD creation process is
unnecessary-]
{+results+} and [-detrimental. Entities are drawn as ovals and
flows-] {+the implications that+} are [-drawn as lines with arrows.

A useful technique employed to differentiate important
examples was to highlight-] {+derived from+} the [-difference between a pen-] {+analysis of those
results. Am I confusing you?
Participant: Data, Information,+} and {+Knowledge. In my books, you analyze data. And generate new Information. New Information can generate+} a
[-computer. A pen is-] {+new... So, I have+} a [-classic example of-] {+model in my head, and this is what+} a [-Heideggerian readyto-hand tool [15].1 We-] {+noun 46+}
should [-not consider a pen an entity, as it-] {+be. And that model is Knowledge. That model could be shifted

slightly. A shift in some model (physical or whatever)+} is {+due to new
Knowledge.

Participant: Within that discussion
Interviewer: we have that iteration. I need to figure out how to represent that iteration. In here we’ve got Knowledge being generated, does
it go anywhere?
Participant: For+} a [-transparent component of-] {+start, it comes back –+} the [-participant’s expression.

However, a computer should-] {+Knowledge is then transmitted back via information to these guys. We won’t provide that to them.

There may+} be [-considered an entity as it
performs transformations outside-] {+a little bit, but you’re not explicitly... It’s in+} the [-scope-] {+form+}
of {+Information returned to+} the [-participant’s
mind. If-] {+external organization via an external
noun 42
Interviewer: By them analyzing+} the [-participant-] {+updated noun 42 they see their
own new Information, which means they can generate their own Knowledge?
Participant: No, I don’t think they’d do that necessarily. The distinction
here+} is [-having trouble figuring out-] {+these are research position 41... they’re an external service
provider. If you have+} a [-scenario
they would like-] {+contract for wanting you+} to [-diagram, the entity dictionary section can be
expanded into-] {+do some work on
your home for example,+} a [-brainstorming section. They should be
prompted-] {+plumber, you won’t necessarily tell them
about what it is that you’re going+} to [-brainstorm all the entities commonly involved in
their work: people, machines, and important documents.

From-] {+do with+} this [-stage, the interviewer should encourage the
participant to define two entities-] {+device, you just tell
them I want that fixed, and I want that service provided. and that’s
whats happening here. We’re asking them+} to [-start out their bubble
diagrams. One of these entities should involve one of their job
roles. They should not be allowed-] {+perform tests and asking
them+} to [-define an entity as
“myself.” Instead, they should label-] {+provide us Data. We’ll assess+} the [-self-entity according to-] {+data, there’s no interaction
with+} the [-type of work-] {+position 43. They’re just providing+} that [-it does. This differentiation is important
because-] {+service.

Interviewer: Therefore do you sink your Knowledge somewhere else
here so that other+} people can [-serve as multiple entities if they play
different, discrete, roles in an organization. Once-] {+take it?
Participant: Yes.

Interviewer: So let’s name that.

Participant: We’ve named+} these [-entities
are established, flows should be drawn from the entity
representing the person to the other. This flow should be
categorized in two ways. Above the line,-] {+position 39 but we could probably
name them more specifically as position 47 because over here because+}
the [-content of-] {+next offshoot here,+} the
[-flow should be written. Once there,-] {+other entity is+} the [-participant should be
asked-] {+position 48.

Interviewer: You,+} to [-categorize the flow as “Data,-] {+them, send...

Participant: Information. We provide them with+} Information,
[-Knowledge, or Other.” They are welcome to use combined
terms,-] but [-should be encouraged-] {+they
might ask for explanation+} as [-to explain how something-] {+well, so therefore we give them Knowledge.

Interviewer: First step+} is [-both “Data and Information” as there are a number of ways
that that combination can-] {+you’re sending them Information. You’re
sending them what Information?
Participant: It will+} be [-interpreted. Participants should
always expand the category of other, when used, into-] {+something –+} a [-specific
category like “Wisdom”.

The intent of the bubble diagram portion-] {+summary+} of the [-interview is
to cause people to develop real definitions of their philosophies
of data through categorization. The first entity-] {+summary+} that [-they define
defines not only-] {+has
just been produced. It could be+} a [-role that they play-] {+presentation. Executive summary if
you want.

Participant: now, I put+} in [-an organization, but
also hopefully the role through which they-] {+this category, generally speaking what happens is when you get to this point you+} will [-categorize the
data flows. My research suggests that participants can-] have different [-discrete philosophies of data depending on what role
they are visualizing at the time: my first two interviews were
conducted against the same person, but produced remarkably

different categorization results. In the first interview, we
explored the data dynamics of leading a group in a Facebook
game. In the second, we explored-] {+levels within+}
the [-participant’s work
experience programming-] {+organziation. For example, you might have+} a [-decision support system.

With the bubble diagram complete, the true purpose-] {+general position 41+} of
the
[-interview can finally be revealed: to engage in-] {+operations,+} a [-theoretical
discussion-] {+position 41+} of [-data. The participant should be encouraged to use-] the [-completed bubble diagram to articulate their own ontology
of data, information,-] {+operations,+} and [-knowledge. As most people believe

we refer+} to [-define-] {+as level 4, level 3 and level 2 position 41s. Let’s call them position 41s for a moment, I’ve clumped them+} all [-three terms,
even though information-] {+together under position

Interviewer: So you send to these level 4,3,2 position 41s...

Participant: We would probably send them Information first.The alternative ... we may send them Information. More than likely we’ll sit
down with them+} and [-knowledge are outside-] {+present+} the [-scope-] {+Information.

Interviewer: So there’s some communication+} of [-research. By defining the boundaries-] {+Information,+} and [-interactions

Participant: Ourselves.

Interviewer: And this dovetailed flow+} is [-only

Participant: Recommendations, yeah.

Interviewer: And these recommendations are?
Participant: Recommendations of Information via definition...

Interviewer: So these recommendations are information. Do you transmit Knowledge from this meeting –+} the [-correct methodology,
structure,-] {+position 47+} and [-scaffolding of-] {+yourself to+} the [-technique. A first attempt at
allowing survey participants to “self-scaffold” by reading very
long theoretical descriptions of the technique was a miserable

{+position 49? How can we render this Knowledge transfer? So you’re
sending Knowledge...

Participant: It’s that IP. It’s like this. You say here is new Information,
here is what we interpret+} as [-part of a

Participant: So these guys in this project+} would [-not-] {+then – these are position

the [-philosophy of data-] {+Noun 21 noun 51ers. verb 52 and negotiate noun 53 and that sort+}
of

Interviewer: and that’s just an Information flow? What do they do?
Participant: They will send stuff back.

Interviewer: Do you care about+} the [-interviews-] {+stuff they send back?
Participant: Yes, we do. They will send specifications back to these
guys here.

Interviewer: And these specifications?
Participant: Noun 21 specifications
Interviewer:+} and [-survey. As a check on-] {+these Noun 21 specifications are?
Participant: Data.

Interviewer: And+} the

of-] {+position 49
Interviewer: Are they modulating this or are they just passing it on?
Participant: They’re just passing it on. And that’s where it sits, because
these are+} the [-interview transcript.


In rethinking-] {+guys that actually...

Interviewer: What else? Are there any other flows in this noun 97?
Participant: There are only other flows over here, but they’re outside...

Probably there is, but that looks pretty good for me.

...

Interviewer: This diagram is your how does one turn into+} the [-survey,-] {+other,
which means that you’re stating that one can turn into+} the [-first item under consideration
was, “what question am-] {+other. Which
is important because not everyone believes that.

Participant: Mind you, having gone through that,+} I [-trying-] {+was thinking all
along: this is no different+} to [-answer?”-] {+any other activity you might end up doing
anyway.+} The [-failure of-] {+fact is that there is an position 43, but in+} the
[-first attempt required-] {+end it could
be anybody.

Interviewer: It’s just someone who applies+} the [-rethinking-] {+SOP. they’re a clearinghouse.

...

Interviewer: Let’s spend this time chatting about your philosophies+} of [-objectives, not the
simple rearticulation-]
{+Data, Information, and Knowledge. Let’s begin by going: “Can you give
me your own definition+} of [-methodologies. The objective-] {+these three terms?”
Participant: Of Data? I guess I+} was
[-rephrased as “how-] {+sort of doing it here, in a way. It’s
what you+} do [-people categorize different data-driven
interactions between people?” The interview used-] the
[-participants’ own experiences as-] {+Data... What is Data there? Data in itself, if you look
at numbers on a sheet of paper, multidimensional,+} these [-interactions, but the
objective does not require-] {+are numbers
in this case. An example using just numbers. Looking at+} that [-level-] {+assemblage+} of [-specificity. Their own
experience was neither sufficient nor required-] {+Data points, it’s hard+} to [-understand
how people categorize data, merely-] {+come up with some mental model.

Particularly if it’s multifactorial.


Interviewer: So one of these is+} a [-useful foil in context-] {+data point?
Participant: All+} of
[-the interview. Reflection showed that it was possible to abstract
away person-specific descriptions-] {+them are
Interviewer: Each+} of [-flows and entities-] {+them is a data point+} and [-all
of the terminology to look at-] {+collectively they are data?
Participant: Yeah. But it’s+} the [-core-] {+interpretation+} of the [-question: how does-] {+data which is required. That can be done by your own mind, but it can be done in+} a [-specific role categorize data, information, and knowledge?

Figure 1 shows-]
{+more systematic way: steadfastly, there is tools. You have excel tools,
excel software. You have other statistical analysis tools.

Interviewer: So data + analysis through tools creates Information?
Participant: Creates Information, yeah. Ultimately, where this is going
to end up is, I’ve got+} a [-bubble diagram rendered-] {+model+} in [-Graphviz as

[-Then, participants were asked-] {+and I’m analyzing the Data, and I want+} to [-categorize twenty-six very

ANALYSIS

This research, being primarily exploratory, had two
statements-] {+practical side+} of [-intent designed to guide the abductive process.

Furthermore, I intentionally discarded formal “rules” about
what data has to be. Participants were allowed to use the term
as it came to them naturally, be-] it [-singular-] {+is:
communicated, argued, and then agreed+} or [-plural. If no clear
usage was found, the term “as” was used in-] {+discarded.

Interviewer: So you’ve got+} the [-summary.

The first, “People-] {+Knowledge which is bound into or discarded from your knowledge-of-world, since we can’t+} have [-different philosophies of data” was
phrased so that analysis would try to detect differences between
philosophies. While-] {+impressive

German terms.... At some point+} in [-the future, with-] this [-work as a
foundation, it-] {+chain, you issue normative orders: “You+} should [-be possible to create falsifiable statements
predicting philosophies of data according to various
demographics like educational background and workplace
duties, the imposition of strict hypotheses at this time would
have unduly biased the results. The statement-] {+do this.” Those normative orders, here, are function+}
of [-interest would
serve to focus-] {+your noun 42?
Participant: They’re represented by+} the [-analysis in useful directions.

The second statement-] {+noun 42, and they’re represented by that Information.

Interviewer: Your classification+} of [-interest, “My methodology can
probe people’s philosophies-] {+these orders, these “You should do
something” is it part+} of [-data” served in a similar role.

Its presence was a memento mori-] {+this model, or is it part+} of a [-kind:-] {+different model?
Participant:+} I [-was using
untested methodologies-] {+see what you’re getting back+} to [-explore-] {+this... which is+} a [-new philosophy. The
statement of interest required self-reflection onto the efficacy
of the methodology and forced me to assess if-] {+flat...+} I [-was actually
capturing real philosophies-]
{+think it’s, in practice, I think it’s seperate. particularly in practice –
Participant: Let’s say we’ve got scientific or technical Knowledge. And
think+} of [-data.

Over a set-] {+it back over here, it’s sort+} of [-ten interviews, three distinct philosophies-] {+like technical Knowledge is sort+}
of
[-data arose: data as bits, data as hard numbers,-] {+in here.

Interviewer: Technical Knowledge is where?
Participant: See, you have learnt new things. Sorry, these are results
plus summary+} and {+analysis. You’re generating, performing
Interviewer: You’re performing the+} data {++ analysis into Information
into Knowledge.

Participant: So, now, it’s expressed here+} as
[-recorded observations. These philosophies seemed to stem
mainly from educational background. Despite these different
philosophies however, the terms “raw data” and “derived data”
were used by members of the group as a strictly defined,
though implicit, local language.

The philosophy of “data-] {+IP. I guess in that case it
is coming back up, it’s Information. So, in effeect, we described it+} as [-bits” seems-]
{+Information.

Interviewer: We’ve described that Knowledge generation noun 97...

Participant: has provided new Information+} to be {+provided to+} the [-product of
understanding data as something inherently technological. The
data as bits philosophy considers that computers are the
ultimate arbiters of data:-] {+noun
60 position 90s.

Interviewer: and+} they {+can then+} take [-in signs as input from
human and transform them into data, communicate the signs as
data, and reproduce the signs as data. Humans then, through
analysis, transform-] that [-computer-mediated data into-] information and [-knowledge. Books are only frozen
communications and do not count as data-transmitting devices.

Data-] {+put it into
their own cycle?
Participant: Yeah. They can. In fact I’m sure it happens like that, too.

The reason I’m ???+} is [-an electronic storage media-] that [-contains encoded
human produced information and knowledge.

The philosophy of “data as hard numbers” seems to be
espoused mainly by scientists. They understand data-] {+there’s probably a filter here before it gets+} to [-be the
product of measurements carried out in-]
{+noun 60 position 90s.

Interviewer: So we’ve got Technical Knowledge, and this Technical
Knowledge is this IP? No.

Participant: It’s that IP. Put through+} a [-scientifically precise
manner. Whether-] {+filter, so that these people will
understand better.

Interviewer: This filter is?
Participant: What it is is+} the [-measurements are for experiments or for-] {+executive summary. What becomes is –
that’s+} the [-process control of manufacturing, they serve as data:
objective, reproducible, unambiguous measurements with-] {+executive summary what it is over here+} a
[-precisely understood set of meta-data. The meta-data:
provenance, location, time taken,-] {+detailed summary,
if you want, but it’s more than that.

Interviewer: Detailed summary+} and [-amount-] {+stuff. And then it’s winnowed into
this executive summary.

Participant: It’s sort+} of [-error, does not
count as data. They merely are factors influencing-] {+like+} the [-analysis
of-] {+questions you want – you’ll have some
questions in your mind+} that [-data. Data must be objective, and should stand on its
own as-] {+these people will want answered. so they’ve
got objectives: do I, or don’t I change Noun 21 noun 51? That’s the
question. You’re anticipating that question, so therefore you generate

216+}

a [-persuasive mechanism.


The philosophy-] {+summary+} of [-“data as observations” seems to be an
engineering philosophy. This camp understands data as the
recorded product-] {+or a distillation+} of [-observations. That everything produces
data and our knowledge allows us-] {+this detailed stuff to present+} to [-filter out “irrelevant” data.

Important data is then turned into information by
contextualizing it against other data through relationships
provided by the observer’s knowledge. Some of-] them [-believe-]
{+to address that.

Interviewer:+} that [-instead of a hierarchical process, data, information, and
knowledge exist-] {+distillation is?
Participant: Is – over here we’ve got information. And we’ve said IP,+} in [-a feedback cycle. Data-]
{+part. but over here the distillation+} is [-subjective, a
recorded instantiation-] {+the application+} of [-observation.

The surveys produced less conclusive results as-] {+– no, it’s quite
separate. So you’ve got new Knowledge, which is then put through+} a [-number
of responses indicated erroneous understanding of-]
{+filter which is – its nothing to do with+} the [-scenarios
or the purpose of the survey. Considering the much wider
groups surveyed: intelligence officers, database developers,
and-] {+technical. it’s+} more [-research scientists; their responses do seem-] {+about,
let’s call it, a social. It’s non-technical. It’s about how+} to [-fall-] {+explain to you
what I know? So I will try to put it+} into [-the rough classifications-] {+... I’ll try to work out what you’re
likely to understand, so I’m thinking: “Well, he’s not a social scientist,
he’s a IST person, so therefore he’ll understand some noun 109. So I’ll
put some maths or a relationship there. But if you were a salesperson
with a marketing degree, probably forget about that.” The filter is a
verb 112+} of [-the interviews. Obviously, far-] {+– it’s a device that permits+} more [-research-] {+effective transmission
of information between one entity+} and [-refinement-] {+another. And in this case it’s
probably a filter around “What will that person understand?”
Interviewer: I think one way+} of [-the survey methodology-] {+talking about that filter+} is
[-required before any positive statements-] {+a local language. That we evolve that we know, that when we’re speaking to each
other that we have these specific terms that are locally true but not
globally true.

Participant: It’s certainly jargon, if you want to put it that way. It’s
more than that, it’s... the way that Information+} can be [-made. At this-] {+communicated
is based on level of people. Meaning+} time, [-however,-] {+availability. But it’s also,
what I was saying earlier, about Knowledge.

Interviewer: That distinction+} is [-useful academically. It not only serves as a useful

Participant: This doesn’t necessarily provide – that’s Knowledge, because it’s+} the [-theory of multidisciplinary thought
and ventures,-] {+IP,+} but [-as a way of prototyping synergistic
interactions between ventures. It can also serve academically as-] {+the executive summary is Information via recommendation. But that’s really+} a [-basis for consulting services; as it offers an ontologically

Interviewer: And that decision+} is [-useful both in conjunction with other
ethnographic research techniques and alone, identifying how-] an
[-organization thinks about its collective memory (data in
databases) and the dysfunctions of communication and

Finally, the philosophy of data will be quite useful-] {+order+} to

VIII. CONCLUSION

It-] {+noun 42
is Information. Or+} is [-my hope that other research avenues will attempt using-] the [-SDFN. It should not be confined to a fledgling field of
philosophy and will be useful in any investigation into how
people think about things.


The philosophy-] {+difference sort+} of [-data seeks to understand how different

Participant: Well, the decision+} is [-not part of
some grand scheme to present-] {+almost really Data? In+} a [-unified theory of data,-] {+way. It’s
Information,+} but [-a
tool built to allow better technologies and to provide a way for
businesses to function more efficiently.

The ideas of silos between different individuals and groups
being partially caused by linguistic disconnects in the most
fundamental medium of business exchange (data), is-] {+it’s also ... no, it’s Information. I was thinking whether
or+} not [-the
only conclusion of this research. Better,-] it [-should serve as a
sample of a potential product: improving efficiency by
reducing both epistemological-] {+was Data. you’re just saying, it’s yes or no. In that context “Do
I or don’t I?”+} and [-ontological errors. While-] {+you’re saying “Do”, to+} the [-primary business of technologists-] {+noun 51 person. It’s 1, go.

Interviewer: And that Boolean decision+} is [-in producing
technology,-] {+still Information?
Participant:+} I [-hope-] {+think that’s Data, that’s what I’m saying.

Interviewer: Perhaps+} this [-research is a reminder to us all that
there are real philosophical bases for anything we create, and
that, by assessing how other people construct their
understanding of-] {+decision ...

Participant: It’s informing+} the [-world, we can make our technologies
more useful-] {+person+} to {+do something like+} the [-people who will use them.

This research seems-] {+noun

[-remarkably varied philosophies-] {+D: 1/0

Participant: Yes, yeah. It’s yes or no, but behind+} the
[-assertion. A poor methodology would most likely produce
either low detail-] {+yes+} or [-similar results. However, as-] no [-statistical
analysis-] is [-applicable to-] this [-analysis, it-]
{+other Information. It’s what+} is [-impossible to assert
that-] {+supporting+} the [-revelations are statistically significant, merely-] {+yes or the no. What
Information is supporting+} that [-they

have different DBs.

Interviewer: Should we generalize your request to those DBs? Is it possible to put one request to any of those databases under one heading?
Participant: Yes, I suppose it is. We call that fact-finding or something.

I wouldn’t sort of treat them differently. Because they’re sort of just
numbers anyways.

Interviewer: This flow of fact-finding to the DBs, is it Data, Information,
Knowledge or other?
Participant: It’s just Data, numbers, from measurements.

Interviewer: So you, to the DBs, are sending Data?
Participant: No, I’m collecting Data. The equipment is...

Interviewer: We’ve got a flow from you to the DBs of Fact finding. What
is that flow? Is it Data, Is it Information, is it Knowledge, or is it smething else?
Participant: I’d just ask...

Interviewer: So you asking to retrieve – are you sending the computers,
Data, Information, Knowledge, or something else? Or nothing?
Participant: Or nothing. no, no, I just ask for – I want a list of numbers.

Interviewer: So that statement of list, you don’t categorize as Data,
Information, or Knowledge?
Participant: No, I haven’t. But I suppose it is Knowledge, because I put
together the question encoded to my Knowledge. I would be sending
that Knowledge, even if the DB doesn’t acknowledge it.


Interviewer: You are sending it Knowledge because it’s a representation
of your Knowledge?
Participant: Yeah. I choose, I suppose, And expand beyond that, to
extract the Data, think on a little bit more would be someone else doing
the same job might extract some other Data
Interviewer: because they don’t have the same Knowledge?
Participant: Yeah.

Interviewer: Now, you send a Knowledge flow of fact-finding to the DBs.

What do you get back?
Participant: I would get back numbers, I suppose? Again the facts.

Hopefully the facts and not fiction. I wouldn’t know. I have to examine
the Data. And that’s sort of – when I retrieve the Data, you go through
the Data, and you sort of quality control, I would think. Based on my
Knowledge. That’s no fun. The scrutiny of Data.

Interviewer: Let’s set that aside for a second. You get back from the
production DB Data, yes? It’s not Information or Knowledge, right?
Participant: No, it’s just Data.

Interviewer: The Data you get back, just like you’re sending fact-finding
flow. What do you call a flow you get back from a DB?
Participant: I suppose it’s some Knowledge too, I suppose. Or results
or ... It would be results. It’s the result of something.

Interviewer: Of your fact-finding
Participant: Yeah.

Interviewer: This is what we’re looking at. You as your lecture author,
send fact-finding Knowledge flow to the production DB. They respond
with a Data flow of results.

Participant: Yep.

Interviewer: Now you mentioned books. How can we build something
like that to books?
Participant: The books would have a big part in the fact finding. In
what Knowledge I would sort of send...

Interviewer: The first question is, if we’re treating a set of books as an
entity, is there a flow from you to the books?
Participant: At this point, I couldn’t think of one. No, I wouldn’t be able
to tell the books anything.

Interviewer: Would you consider the selection of a particular book from
a set of books a sense of communication from you to the entity. Or is it
just access which isn’t communication?
Participant: It’s just access.

Interviewer: From the books to you, however, is there a flow?
Participant: Of Knowledge. A Knowledge flow.


Interviewer: so there’s a Knowledge flow. This Knowledge flow, what
can we label?
Participant: Theories. And I suppose Theories and experiences. Depending on what...

Interviewer: so the books can provide a Knowledge flow of experiences?
Participant: Yeah.

Interviewer: Is it separate from the Knowledge flow of theories?
Participant: No, it would be probably one. I think books would be
either/or. If it’s not something published where somebody did investigation. But if you look at printed books, they’re either theories or
both. Even in the books, they would use sometimes examples based on
production data.

Interviewer: You as lecture author use books and the production database to generate your lecture. Do you use anything else to generate
your lecture?
Participant: It would be more illustrations.

Interviewer: Where do you get the illustrations from?
Participant: It could be drawings... or if its equipment, that would be
from our noun 89.

Interviewer: What entity should we label it as, noun 89?
Participant: Yeah.

Interviewer: now this noun 89, do you send it anything as part of this
noun 97?
Participant: Not more than a request for a certain drawing. I just usually
go to someone who has to print out the... I would ask...

Interviewer: What do you do? You ask the archive...

Participant: for a particular text.

Interviewer: how can we label this flow?
Participant: Drawing Request.

Interviewer: This drawing request, is it Data, Information, Knowledge,
or other?
Participant: Other, I suppose. Or it’s the same with the Data. We’ll ask
for something specific because of what I want – I suppose it’s a little
bit of Knowledge in that. It’s based on what I want to show so it might
just be – I would relay when my word?? comes back, it’s more like
Information.

Interviewer: So you send a drawing request, which is an expression of
expertise? i.e. Knowledge? Or is it something else?
Participant: Somethign else. I mean, I don’t know anything about it.

Interviewer: you just say I want such and such.


Participant: Because I want just show something practical or have need
or practical use of it together with some other data or some event or
whatever.

Interviewer: So that request, if we’re putting it in the other category, I
need to label it something. What would you label it as, category wise?
Participant: So you have Knowledge,
Interviewer: Information, and Data.

Participant: I think I’m sending it Knowledge, I suppose, because I know
something. I have Knowledge about something, that’s why I need this
particular drawing.

Interviewer: Because you have Knowledge, you’re sending that Knowledge to them?
Participant: I never thought I was sending something more than the
request for Information. Or get back, it’s just – that’s a little bit harder.

Interviewer: Let’s have the flow back, what’s the flow back from the
drawings?
Participant: That’s Information, yeah.

Interviewer: Now, what is this Information? What is the drawing
archive sending you as Information?
Participant: what would you call a drawing?
Interviewer: You said illustration earlier. Would it be illustrations,
would it be something else?
Participant: It would be a scaled drawing of some equipment.

Interviewer: And this drawing is Information?
Participant: Yeah.

Interviewer: But the drawing request is not Information?
Participant: No, I suppose it would be...

Interviewer: I’m not trying to put words in your mouth. Don’t use the
exclusion... don’t go: “Well, it’s not Data, and it’s not Knowledge, so it
has to be Information”
Participant: Of course I have a reason why I want this particular...

Interviewer: But you’re not communicating this reason, are you?
Participant: No. You go to the computer “I want this drawing. and send
it to this printer.”
Interviewer: Is that meta-data, is that communication?
Participant: I suppose I’m sending it Data, because I’m just punching
in a few numbers.

Interviewer: That’s different from the fact-finding Knowledge, yes?
Participant: Yeah.


Interviewer: So you are sending the noun 89 Data, because the drawing
request is Data.

Participant: Yeah, that’s right.

Interviewer: But you get back Information as the drawing.

Participant: Yeah.

Interviewer: You then take results from the production database, theories and experiences from books, and drawings from the noun 89 and
what do you do with them?
Participant: I produce the material.

Interviewer: Now, what do you do with that material?
Participant: I would produce sort of lecture materials which I would –
would give us communicate with the position 90.

Interviewer: Who would the lecture materials go to in terms of roles?
Participant: It goes to me as the lecturerer.

Interviewer: so the lecture author sends to the lecturer lecture material.

Participant: Yes.

Interviewer: This lecture material, is this Data, Information, or Knowledge?
Participant: I would say all three.

Interviewer: So this is Data and Information and Knowledge.

Participant: I would say that it’s Information and Data.

Interviewer: It’s Knowledge?
Participant: It’s Knowledge. I suppose it makes up your Knowledge if
you say Knowledge is based on Information and Data.

Interviewer: Is it?
Participant: Knowledge... you learn from something. Experiences
which can be either a specific experience Knowledge... but. Because
if you’re just sending Data, and the reciever is the person who has to
come up with the – make up the Knowledge part.

Interviewer: So the author is sending Data, Information, and Knowledge to the lecturer.

Participant: That’s the material container.

Interviewer: Does the author send anything else to the lecturer?
Participant: Not that I can think of.

Interviewer: Now, what does the lecturer do with that lecture material?
Participant: Communicate to the recievers. Now it’s the case of position
90s, or the class.

Interviewer: Lecturer sends to the position 90s, what?

Participant: I would say mainly the Knowledge part. That’s the big
thing. That’s the purpose.

Interviewer: So the lecturer sends to the position 90s Knowledge of,
what can we label this?
Participant: It’s Technical Knowledge.

Interviewer: Since we have 4 minutes left, let’s do a very brief theory
session. What is Data?
Participant: For me? It’s Information. It’s some kind of recorded readings, values of ??? discontinuous or continuous flow of events.

Interviewer: Now you mentioned the term Information. Can you define
Data again for me?
Participant: Information I suppose... is a measure of the Data, as opposed to the measurable property.

Interviewer: So Data is a measure of a property?
Participant: Yeah, for me.

Interviewer: What is Information?
Participant: Information for me, would be more of the numbers.... but
more sort of verbal text. For me, Information is text, and Data is this
numbers. But even a text could be Data.

Interviewer: How is text Data?
Participant: Because sometimes text could describe a measure better
than a number, I think. Depending on what you want to use it for.

Interviewer: so a measure of a property can be either qualitative or
quantitative. Whereas Information is what?
Participant: I would say it’s a quality, I think. Information, I suppose,
can mix with all Data, Knowledge. Something that you relate – it goes
from one source to another. Any kind of Data or Knowledge is some
kind of Information.

Interviewer: So would you say Information is a container for Data and
Knowledge? Some sort of communicative thing?
Participant: Yeah, I would think. Or, ??? when you’re just looking
at numbers... Information I suppose is a continouus flow of Data and
numbers and Knowledge sort of ...

Interviewer: Okay. What’s Knowledge?
Participant: That’s harder. Knowledge could be your perception of
something. If that’s what you think you know, anyways.

Interviewer: Knowledge is what you think you know?
Participant: For me, yeah. But I suppose someone has some other
Knowledge which I could sort of receive too, and then it becomes my
Knowledge.


Interviewer: How can someone give you Knowledge? Do they just give
you Knowledge, or do they give you Knowledge through something
else?
Participant: You can recieve Knowledge, I suppose. Text, verbally, visual.

Interviewer: But the flow would still be a Knowledge flow, it wouldn’t
be a Data flow or an Information flow?
Participant: It could be all. You can find Knowledge in ... you could
get direct Knowledge as sort of verbal, but you can also recieve Data
but then you sort of have to compute the Data for it to become Knowledge. I think the Data itself does not become Knowledge until you do
something with the Data.

Interviewer: What about Information?
Participant: It’s the same, I think. You still have to do something. You
have to put it in perspective.

Interviewer: Three very quick questions. First, is Data atomic, can you
divide data? Is there something that’s more... fundamental than Data?
Participant: Not that I can think of.

Interviewer: Is there something above Knowledge? Is there something
that combines Knowledge into something bigger than itself?
Participant: That’s a religious question.

Interviewer: Yes, it can be.

Participant: I wouldn’t be able to describe it. I sometimes think that
there’s something even above Knowledge.

Interviewer: But we don’t have a ...

Participant: No.

Interviewer: When someone tells you to do something: “You should
do this” are they communicating Data, Information, Knowledge, or
something else to you?
Participant: I think they’re giving me Information, I would think. Instruction is ... that comes with a consequence. If I have to do something.

I think they’re sending me Information, I would think. Which I would
probably transform into some kind of Knowledge. Of what the consequences would be if I don’t go along with the Informational instruction.

Interviewer: If you’re making predictive statements about the future,
or from the past to the present, are those predictive statements, Data,
Information, or Knowledge? And what are you using to create them?
Participant: It would be Knowledge. And I would be using Information
and Data to produce these Knowledge.

Interviewer: How does experience turn into predictions?
Participant: Intuition.


Interviewer: You’d say experience is Knowledge?
Participant: It’s not perhaps, it’s part of the Knowledge.

Interviewer: and you’d say that causal models are part of Knowledge?
Like if I’ve got these inputs, this output would happen?
Participant: Yeah, sort of, predictive models ... they would be Knowledge, yeah.


7.9 Interview 9
Interviewer: Let’s model both topics.

Participant: Do we have time?
Interviewer: No, but I want to model both. Let’s do the noun 91 first.

Participant: it’s probably more relevant to this particular group. In
that there was very little interaction from the reline in terms of work
that I did.

Interviewer: I’m going to skip the entity dictionary. Normally what
I do with people is: let’s just go through and figure out what entities
there are. What I’m going to do instead is describe to you what an
entity could be, and we’ll just jump in because I’d love to get both. An
entity is a role that someone or something plays. Tools can be entities
if they’re not ready to hand. A pen isn’t an entity because when I’m
writing, I don’t go “pen.” But, SAS is probably an entity because I’ll
be doing lexical analysis through it. If it’s providing a transformation,
it’s an entity. You, yourself, can have multiple entities. As a noun 91
student, I’ve got position 56 hat, I’ve got teaching assistant hat, I’ve
got grader hat, I’ve got database position 31 hat. Just because I’m one
person doesn’t meant I’m one entity. So, starting with the noun 91.

...

Interviewer: This is looking at both your noun 91 methodology and the
noun 91 noun 97. The surrounding... We’ll start by modeling a trivial
noun 97 in your noun 91. because it’s best to start slow. Which entity
would you like to characterize yourself as first?
Participant: Me?
Interviewer: You as?
Participant: I guess as a position 56? The one doing the work.

Interviewer: As a position 56. You’ve got flows of stuff. I use the word
stuff because I’m not going to day Data, Information, or Knowledge. Or
other. To someone else. What is a trivial flow of stuff to someone else
and who is that other person?
Participant: I guess the trivial stuff would be reporting: talking about
progress, results. So my main position 92s here are [name] and [name].

The SDFN Diagram for Interview 9
...

Interviewer: So, position 56 to position 92s. What are you sending
them?
Participant: I’m sending them Information. I meet with them about
once a week to talk about what I’ve done. It might be results that I’ve
gotten, that I can show them. It might just be talking about how things
are going.

Interviewer: Do we want to differentiate that? This diagram is atemporal. Everything is superimposed because dealing with reality is such
a pain. Let’s break that down into multiple flows. You’re telling them
what you’ve done.

Participant: yeah.

Interviewer: Do we have a better label than “what you’ve done?”
Participant: Progress?
Interviewer: Now, you send them a flow of stuff about progress. Now
this flow of stuff could just be a conversation, but it’s still a transfer of...

stuff. The stuff you identified is Information?
Participant: As in results?
Interviewer: Your progress update. Is your progress update Data, Information, Knowledge, or other?
Participant: Information?
Interviewer: You may also send them Results. These results are?
Participant: Data.

Interviewer: Do you send them anything else in these usual meetings?
Participant: What about concerns? Can you send concerns? Emotions?
Frustration?
Interviewer: Do you want to summarize them as one flow?
Participant: Concerns, I guess, is the right one.

Interviewer: These concerns that we all have are what?
Participant: Well they’re not Data. They’re not really Knowledge. So
I’m assuming they’re Information.

Interviewer: Don’t use exclusions.

Participant: Can they be emotion?
Interviewer: Sure. Is the communication of emotions a unique concept?
Or is covered under the other categories? Is emotion distinct in itself
or is it part of some larger superset?
Participant: I would have thought that it would be distinct in itself. ...

I’m going to think that emotions are separate. [someone else] probably
wouldn’t look at that.

Interviewer: This is a really useful interview.


Participant: Because it’s true! I’m a lot more emotional than a lot of
the [group] are. And so, for me, communicating emotions and getting
feedback and getting my emotions right is important for me...

Interviewer: And this is distinct from Data, Information, and Knowledge?
Participant: yeah.

Interviewer: Do you send them anything else?
Participant: No, I think that covers my part.

Interviewer: What do they send you?
Participant: I’d probably break it down into feedback and guidance.

Interviewer: Feedback is?
Participant: It’s Information. Yeah, I’d put that one as Information.

That’s responding to what I’ve done and telling me how they think
things are going. Whereas guidance is probably more Knowledge, because that’s more pushing me in certain directions or giving me the
understanding that I need in order to progress in different directions.

Interviewer: What you’re identifying here are normative statements:
“You should do this.” I’ll want to unpack those later. So, your position
92 sends back feedback and guidance. Do they send anything else?
Participant: Occasionally they’ll send – there’s a problem where I’ve
done something and it hasn’t given the results we expected. And so
[name’s] done the work himself and then provided results back for me
to compare to.

Interviewer: So these are comparative results?
Participant: yeah. They’d be Data.

Interviewer: Who/what else do you work with? Do you get or send
flows to as a position 56?
Participant: My other position 92 who is my [location] position 92.

Because he’s kind of separate. Because I don’t talk to him that often.

Interviewer: adjective 93 position 92? or ignored position 92?
Participant: Hey, it goes both ways.

Interviewer: You to your adjective 93 position 92 send what?
Participant: The main thing would be progress, than anything.

Interviewer: as Information?
Participant: Yes.

Interviewer: Is it the same progress?
Participant: More condensed. So it’s not the same progress. I’ll talk to
him every few months or so and I’ll talk to them every week.

Interviewer: Condensed you would say?

Participant: Maybe summary.

Interviewer: Summary of progress is?
Participant: Information.

Interviewer: Does he send anything back?
Participant: ...

Interviewer: Sorry, in the best of all possible worlds, does he send
anything back?
Participant: Occasionally?
Interviewer: What does he send back?
Participant: Occasionally he sends back guidance, Knowledge.

Interviewer: Is it the same guidance?
Participant: No, different Knowledge.

Interviewer: How can we differentiate these guidances?
Participant: I don’t know. Direction?
Interviewer: Tell me this guidance versus this guidance. They send you
what?
Participant: They [local position 92s] send me kind of week to week guidance. At the moment I’ve been developing a ... model to try and describe
[undesired chemical interaction]. And so I’ve developed something to
counteract that. So, over the noun 97 of developing that, [name] has
kind of given me direction in terms of: “Oh, should we consider this
model instead?” and I’ll try that and it won’t work. And I’ll say OK, that
one didn’t work, what about this. And point me in different directions.

and then I’ll do the work and come back and say none of the work serves
what I’ve done, which is what happens. Whereas with my adjective 93
position 92 it’s more of, I’ll present him a summary of what I’ve worked
on for the last 2-3 months and say “This is where I’m planning to go.”
More of the higher up position 92 than a day to day thing. And I’ll
kind of talk more about this is my plan for where I’m heading based on
what I’ve done. And he’ll provide kind of direction and, if necessary,
Information on different things I’m planning on doing.

Interviewer: So this directed guidance, as Knowledge, so he provides ...

Participant: when I say Information, I mean papers, or contacts, or
things like that. And that kind of stuff I would classify as Knowledge.

Because it’s stuff he has that I don’t.

Interviewer: so his Knowledge contains Information?
Participant: Yes.

Interviewer: He sends back directed guidance as Knowledge which
contains Information. But the flow is labeled Knowledge, because it’s
an expression of his Knowledge?
Participant: That makes sense.


Interviewer: It actually makes complete sense to me. What else?
Participant: I guess the only other thing he does, as an adjective 93
position 92, is that he can put me in touch with other people. I don’t
know if you have any points for networking.

Interviewer: of course I do. Let’s start with a flow from him to you. He
creates networking opportunities by sending you what?
Participant: Contacts?
Interviewer: Contacts. These contacts are?
Participant: people? names?
Interviewer: These people and names are what?
Participant: So they’re Information. They’re not really Knowledge. I
guess they could be Data. It depends on your definition.

Interviewer: Of course. Are they Data? Are they a different sort of Data
than your other Data?
Participant: If they are Data, then yes they are.

Interviewer: Are they Data?
Participant: I’m an position 58 by background, I can’t tell you anything.

Interviewer: It’s so much fun pinning position 58s down, because they
squirm.

Participant: Yeah, I can feel myself squirming. I would say: “Look, you
can put them in a list. There is a defined quantity. They can be grouped,
they can be ordered or whatever. They probably are Data. You can put
them in a spreadsheet.

Interviewer: But they’re different Data. How can we characterize this
Data as different Data?
Participant: They’re people.

Interviewer: They’re not numbers.

Participant: People don’t like to be defined as numbers. They get all
kind of emotional at me.

Interviewer: So, contacts are Data. Do we want to differentiate this
flow of Data from your other flows of Data? Is it a difference in nature
and kind or just nature? Are you comfortable with us labeling this Data
in the sense that it will be perceived as the same as this other Data?
Participant: Meh.

Interviewer: Excellent. What other entities do we have?
Participant: With my position 56 hat on?
Interviewer: Yes.

Participant: There are other people who I send Information to but don’t
get anything from.


Interviewer: which entity is this?
Participant: [name] as my research position 41. As in the [local company] research position 41.

Interviewer: Research position 41. You’ve got a flow to him of?
Participant: summary of progress.

Interviewer: The same flow. And the type of flow?
Participant: Information?
Interviewer: Are there any flows back to you? Are there any flows back
to other people regarding this interaction?
Participant: Not particularly. It’s just one sided. It’s just as a courtesy,
keeping him in the loop sort of thing. So he knows what’s going on but
doesn’t necessarily have a direct hand.

Interviewer: What else do we have?
Participant: I guess you can put other position 56s at [academic institution], but I don’t do much with them.

Interviewer: If you don’t do much with them, then they’re not relevant.

Two other areas to explore. Communications with yourself wearing
other hats and communication with tools.

Participant: Does my computer count as a tool? That’s really my only
tool.

Interviewer: Do you use different programs on your computer in meaningful ways?
Participant: Not heaps. I do all my coding in C. Well, yeah, I’ve done a
bit of computer programming before but nothing too extensive before
this. But so far I’ve learned C, C++, FORTRAN. They’re not too bad, when
you don’t know anything better, they’re not too bad. So I’ve done most
of my coding in that. I often use one visualization package that I use to
look at results or I just put them in excel.

...

Interviewer: Okay, let’s go with visualization software, and we can lump
excel and your other vis stuff in here unless you think we should
Participant: No that’s fine.

Interviewer: do you send different stuff to your visualization software
than excel?
Participant: Yes and no. I get the same kind of things back from them. I
don’t do an awful lot of transformation stuff. I don’t do a lot of formulas
in excel. I just put the numbers in and get graphs. The visualization
stuff I’m putting numbers in and I’m getting pictures.

Interviewer: And you’ve got, and what entity would you say your programming is? How do you conceptualize it in your head?
Participant: It’s code.


Interviewer: You as position 56, send the entity known as code, what?
Participant: I send it Data. I created it though, so how does...

Interviewer: That’s the question. You send it Data. What Data do you
send it?
Participant: Well I send it the lines that it uses to create the program.

So I send it... I don’t know how you would describe that. I write the
basis of it. I tell it what to do. But I also send it numbers to work with.

Interviewer: Let’s differentiate those into two flows. The numbers it
needs to work with are?
Participant: Data.

Interviewer: And we can label them?
Participant: inputs.

Interviewer: You also send it what?
Participant: I guess I’d classify it as Knowledge. No, it’s Information.

It’s kind of all of the above.

Interviewer: we can certainly combine elements.

Participant: Not really Information.

Interviewer: so you send it what?
Participant: I would call it Knowledge. Because I’m imparting my Knowledge into the code and telling it what to do.

Interviewer: and what will we label this flow?
Participant: Maybe model theory or something?
Interviewer: What other flows are there?
Participant: Well it just sends back results.

Interviewer: Same results or are these results different from these
results?
Participant: They are different. But not in nature. Just in ... obviously
I’m not going to take every result I take from the code and send it on.

Because that would be ridiculous.

Interviewer: So can we say selected results over here?
Participant: Yeah.

Interviewer: What else?
Participant: That’s really about it.

Interviewer: when you do debugging, does it send anything?
Participant: Only when I tell it to.

Interviewer: when you tell it to send you things, does it send you a flow
outside of results?
Participant: not really. I would say...


Interviewer: just different kinds of results? How do you interact with
the visualization software and does your code directly interact?
Participant: no.

Interviewer: How do you interact with the visualization?
Participant: I send it the selected results.

Interviewer: the same selected results?
Participant: Different selected results. You can make it the same as the
one that comes out of the code because, for all intents and purposes
that’s what I use. The visualization package doesn’t always use all of
the results that I send it.

Interviewer: but it’s the same results, there’s no transformation, there’s
just filtering.

Participant: the filtering is usually done inside the package.

Interviewer: you send it results, what does it do?
Participant: it gives me pictures or pretty graphs. like circles and balls.

I’ve got very unexciting pictures.

Interviewer: It sends you back pictures and graphs...

Participant: The pictures come from one software and the graphs come
from the other.

Interviewer: These pictures are?
Participant: Data?
Interviewer: Why are they Data?
Participant: Because they’re based on particular things.

Interviewer: So it’s just Data as representation of Data.

Participant: Yeah.

Interviewer: It also sends you back graphs. These graphs are?
Participant: the same thing.

Interviewer: Data. What else do we have?
Participant: That’s mostly it.

Interviewer: Do any of these entities exchange stuff... about your work?
Participant: to a minor extent. I would say that there’s a minor extent
link between my position 92s and my adjective 93 position 92.

Interviewer: OK, what links are there?
Participant: All I can think about is discussion.

Interviewer: Who is discussing with whom?
Participant: Well, it’s a double sided arrow.

Interviewer: This discussion is?

Participant: Information.

....

Interviewer: Let’s see what we can do on verb 94. Which entity do we
start with for verb 94?
Participant: if we’re looking at it from my point of view, so I was an
position 58.

Interviewer: And what flows are there, to what?
Participant: So my position 41 on the project, we’ll call him the lead
position 58. He was just responsible for our group.

Interviewer: flows, you to lead position 58.

Participant: I’d send him any work that I’ve done. It’s kind of hard to
quantify what I did.

Interviewer: Are there categories of what you did?
Participant: Yeah, there are. Maybe I could break it down to three main
categories. position 58ing noun 95 work, so noun 95 calculations and
stuff like that. Maybe noun 95 calcs?
Interviewer: And these noun 95 calcs are?
Participant: They’re Data. noun 95 calcs, and adjective 96 stuff, documentation I guess I’d call it. adjective 96 stuff is kind of stuff that’s
done, so we do adjective 96 and we go use a Noun 18 or test a valve.

Documentation is all of the documentation that we wrote up ...

Interviewer: Your ... documentation is?
Participant: I don’t know what you’d classify it as. I guess it’s a type of
Data.

Interviewer: Can we separate it out into sub-categories?
Participant: Not really.

Interviewer: So it’s not Information, it’s not Knowledge.

Participant: It’s a kind of a bit of Knowledge and a bit of Information
and a bit of Data all rolled into one document. So what is the document?
Interviewer: Let’s start by: “What is the document?”
Participant: It depends on which document.

Interviewer: What categories of documents are there?
Participant: The main ones are descriptions of the noun 97, describing
what the noun 97es do. I need to explain that I worked mostly on the
noun 98 stuff.

Interviewer: So we’ve got noun 97 description documentation. This
noun 97 description documentation is?
Participant: Well it’s all the above. It’s all of them.

Interviewer: So Knowledge + Information + Data?

Participant: Yeah.

Interviewer: And documentation not including noun 97 description
documentation has what other bits in it?
Participant: adjective 96 reports.

Interviewer: So we have adjective 96 stuff, but that’s different from
adjective 96 reports.

Participant: Yes.

Interviewer: These reports are?
Participant: They’re Information and Data.

Interviewer: But not Knowledge?
Participant: Nope.

Interviewer: Why not?
Participant: Because the Knowledge contained in the noun 97 descriptions is a kind of background behind what was done and why. Whereas
the adjective 96 report is just a description of what was done during
adjective 96 and the results that were obtained. So the dumb stuff is
the Information. And the results are the Data.

Interviewer: are there other categories that we can extract out from
documentation?
Participant: That’ll do for now or we’ll be here all day.

Interviewer: In documentation, the remainder of the documentation
is what?
Participant: Mostly just Information.

Interviewer: The adjective 96 stuff is what?
Participant: I would classify it as adjective 96 results and call it Data.

Interviewer: All right, what else do we have? What other interactions?
...

Interviewer: are there any flows between position 58 and lead position
58?
Participant: The lead position 58 tells me what to do?
Interviewer: What can we label this telling you what to do as?
Participant: Directions sounds a bit too nice but it will do.

Interviewer: Direction is?
Participant: Information, I guess.

Interviewer: Does the lead position 58 send anything else back to you?
Participant: I guess they send back Knowledge. I’m trying to think of
what form that would come under. But say there’s something in the
adjective 96 results that’s not quite as you’d expect it, then they can give
advice as to what could be causing it, or what to do to test something

else. So you could call it noun 97 Knowledge. The point of the lead
position 58 is for them to have more comprehensive understanding of
how things work. You can put some other entities in if you want to.

“Other Position 22s.” My main flow of communication with them... My
background with the project was that I knew how all of the systems
worked because I noun 95ed the system. ... I knew how things worked
and so I would explain to them how things worked. ... I guess my main
flow to them would be noun 97 understanding. Call it Knowledge.

Interviewer: Do they send anything to you?
Participant: They would me adjective 96 results.

Interviewer: The same ones?
Participant: The same Data.

Interviewer: How are they different?
Participant: Well, it could be... they do adjective 96 on?? other systems.

So different results. Whereas the stuff that I send would be whatever
I was involved in. If you want another arrow there, they send those
adjective 96 results to the lead position 58.

Interviewer: so these results are?
Participant: They’re Data.

Interviewer: What else?
Participant: The main one I had was the noun 63 position 58. I’d teach
them about Position 22ing. I’d probably give them the same noun 97
understanding as the others. They would send back. Well, they would
send back understanding of how the noun 63 works. So that would be –
I guess that would be Knowledge. It’s very hard to break it down into
data.

Interviewer: where do you get these noun 95 calculations from?
Participant: I do them. If we want an entity for them, the best thing
is that I do noun 99 modeling, and I use the noun 99 package. That’s a
nice little name for it.

Interviewer: What do you send to the package, and what do you get
back?
Participant: I’d send input, Data. And it gives me, results, Data.

Interviewer: Anything else?
Participant: Well, I don’t know where all the equipment is.

Interviewer: Is the equipment important?
Participant: Probably not. I mean it is important for the job, but probably not.

Interviewer: Does the equipment provide Data, Information, Knowledge, or other?

Participant: Of course it does. It provides all of the above. Well, maybe
not Information or Knowledge... It’s very weird thinking of it as a
Knowledge transferring. Maybe you could call it the noun 63 that’s
giving us Information back. The [object] through it doesn’t really tell
you anything.

Interviewer: OK, the noun 63. What do you send to it? What does it
send to you?
Participant: We don’t really send it anything. Well, I don’t send it
anything.

Interviewer: What does it send to you?
Participant: It sends noun 97 results. Data, because I don’t have anything better.

Interviewer: now you mentioned Information at some point, with regards to this.

Participant: Well, it’s the Information that comes from the results.

Interviewer: where does that Information get...

Participant: transformed? Through the position 58. Well, an position
58 looks at it and goes “Yes, that number looks right. Or no that number
doesn’t look right. It’s broken.”
Interviewer: And that’s a transformation into what?
Participant: It’s a transformation into whether things are working.

...

Interviewer: Define for me, Knowledge. Are there types of Knowledge?
Participant: I would define Knowledge as something that an individual
or entity ... something that an entity possesses. That typically has been
learned from somewhere else or gained from experience or whatever
that enables them a better understanding then they would have otherwise. My understanding of how things would work is that Knowledge
is the noun 97 by which Data is turned into Information. So I would say
Data is things. It’s numbers, it’s raw Information. It is something that,
on its own, doesn’t mean very much. It’s just stuff. Information is an
interpretation of that. So it’s kind of something that is understandable
to someone without Knowledge, without even concept of what the raw
Data is.

Interviewer: So it’s encapsulated something? What is it that’s encapsulated?
Participant: I mean, it can be an explanation of results. It can have
nothing to do with it whatsoever.

Interviewer: So we’ve got Data is transformed by Knowledge into Information. What does Information do and where does it go? It doesn’t
just sit there.

Participant: Information is used as a means of communication.


Interviewer: What is it communicating and does it cause any changes
in anything?
Participant: I don’t know.

Interviewer: Where does emotion fall into this if anywhere?
Participant: Well I’d say it’s fairly separate. However, it can influence
how things are perceived. So it probably has an influence on the Information.

Interviewer: So emotion changes the transformation of Data into Information?
Participant: I’d say it just changes the perception of Information.

Interviewer: So Data goes into Knowledge, what’s this flow?
Participant: Data doesn’t really go into Knowledge.

Interviewer: Sorry...

Participant: Data doesn’t turn into Knowledge. Data turns into Information.

Interviewer: So Data turns into Information. Knowledge...

Participant: creates that link. So if you don’t have Knowledge, the Data
won’t transform very well.

Interviewer: does Knowledge go into Information?
Participant: Yes, Information can be a communication of Knowledge.

Interviewer: Does anything go into Knowledge? How do you get more?
Participant: Through Information.

Interviewer: What is Knowledge?
Participant: understanding inherent to an entity, is how I’d describe it.

Interviewer: Three questions: Is there anything to either side of Data,
Information, or Knowledge? Is there anything that’s lower than Data?
Or is Data atomic?
Participant: I would say Data can be atomic. It stretches across that
width of the spectrum. I would say that it goes from as far as atomic to
as big as macroscopic. It can be anything within that. I’m saying that
in any sense.

Interviewer: Data can be divided or it cannot. If Data is divided, what
is it divided into?
Participant: Subdata?
Interviewer: Is subdata a thing? Or is subdata Data?
Participant: I would say it’s not any different. You could have different
scales of it, but... you could have a group of numbers. You could select
some of that group of numbers. That’s not any different. It’s just still
Data.


Interviewer: So you have a subset of Data which is Data.

Participant: Yeah.

Interviewer: and at some point you just can’t subset any more.

Participant: You could get it right down to the last point... It’s still Data
Interviewer: You could have many points, and that collection of points
is still Data.

Participant: Yeah.

Interviewer: But you have a collection of points, and you apply Knowledge and you get ... Information? And then you’ve got this loop of
Information to Knowledge and Knowledge to Information. Is there
anything beyond Knowledge?
Participant: I would say no. I would say the only thing beyond Knowledge is god. I mean God is all Knowledge. That just gets confusing.

<inaudible>
Interviewer: Because it is part of some people’s ontologies, but it’s
outside the scope of this investigation ... When someone gives you a
normative assertion, it’s what of these, if anything? When someone
orders you to do something, is that Data, Information, or Knowledge?
Participant: None of them.

Interviewer: What is it? Do we have a handy label for it?
Participant: I don’t know. If anything, I’d say it falls under Information,
but I don’t think it does.

Interviewer: So what is Information?
Participant: It’s a lot of stuff.

Interviewer: What’s a component of Information?
Participant: It could be an interpretation of something. It could just be
words. Understanding, words. I would say if someone asks someone to
do something, provides them a direction or a directive, it’s not necessarily a should, but, provides them guidance to what they should do, I
would say that’s Information, they’re giving them Information on what
to do.

Interviewer: The guidance is what to do based on what?
Participant: Based on that entity’s understanding. Based on their
Knowledge or their Information. Or the interpretation they’ve got
of things.

Interviewer: Any final thoughts?
Participant: Nope.

....

Interviewer: ... your use of Emotion as a perception of manipulation
engine is fascinating. So, thank you for that.


Participant: That’s OK. Maybe that’s where should comes into it. Maybe
it that when someone tells you that you should do something, they’re
kind of applying their emotiveness behind it. In that, ??? said, it’s
a manipulative thing. It’s not necessarily a “I’m guiding you to do
this.” It’s a I’m making or telling you that you must do this. So they’re
exercising their manipulativeness over them. Which can be a good
thing. Like a position 41 with an employee might help them to do
something. And that’s manipulation.

Interviewer: and so it’s an emotive communication of...

Participant: status in the hierarchy. Maybe that’s emotive, maybe that’s
not really emotive.

Interviewer: You tell me
Participant: I don’t know. I’ll just confuse myself.


7.10 Interview 10
Interviewer: Let’s model this. A brief discussion on entities. An entitiy
is something, someone, that takes in these flows, performs some sort
of transformation on them, and outputs flows. Or produces flows, or
takes in flows. I would say that, when I was doing tmy masters, I had
three roles: I was a student, I was a teaching assistant, and I was the
database position 31. For purposes of this diagram, I would be three
different entities because not only do they deal with Data, Information,
Knowledge, in different ways, but they can talk to each other. Even
though it’s me talking to me, it’s me as DBA going: I just wrote this lab
me, here are the questions we need to deal with. It’s the DBA talking to
the graduate assistant, there are different ways of dealign with stuff.

We will ignore things that are ready-at-hand. This pen is not an entitiy
because I don’t think about it when I’m writing, I just write. Say I use
that computer and I load up SAS, and I load up the 100,000 words of
transcript that I’ve written so far. And it munges them and it produces
something. SAS is an entitiy becuase it’s taking stuff in and giving
me something. It’s noun 97ing it, and I’m aware that it’s noun 97ing
it. It’s an eneity to me because it’s not just an invisible flow it’s go
there, come back. Scientific instruments can be entities, they can take
stuff... What I’m trying to do is be very vague here so I don’t prejudice
your philosophy. This is why I’m saying if you think doing an entitiy
dictionary is useful we’ll do it. If you’ve got a fairly decent idea, we’ll
start trivial and expand out.

Participant: we’ll start trivial?
Interviewer: Let’s start by talking about one of the really beautiful noun
37 cases we just talked about with that semipermiable membrane. With

The SDFN Diagram for Interview 10
Position 90

Interviewer: we start out by going what is one of the central entities in
this noun 97? probably a role that you play, but it doesn’t have to be.

Participant: As the collector, just call it the noun 129 entity. noun 129.

Interviewer: multiple people can be in one entity.

Participant: noun 129. What happens in the noun 129 well: the inputs
are observations....

Interviewer: What is effectively sending you observations?
Participant: position 90s. We’ll probably do this around [name]. So the
position 90s. These are corridor conversations. You’ll be sitting there
and some position 90 will say: “Do you know such and such?” ... and
the position 90s will come around for a little chat. Because they know
I’m there. And you pick up all sorts of things that are going on. That’s
the informal observations.

Interviewer: So we have position 90s sending a flow to noun 129. This
flow is observations?
Participant: Just observations. They push the buttons in the noun 97.

They hear things, they see things. They know how the noun 97. They
know the differences between the shifts. And if you want to put a
credibility factor on it, around 20
Interviewer: position 90s send you a flow of observations. Here’s the
fun bit. Would you categorize this flow as Data, Information, Knowledge,
or something different?
Participant: Can I pick two?
Interviewer: absolutely.

Participant: Information and Knowledge. Because the Information is
the things that I can reduce to something technical. The Knowledge is
their understanding of the noun 97. ... what’s their perception of the
basis of [their choices]. Information to me would be the technical side
of it. The Knowledge is the operational expertise. So you’re getting
some of those two things coming through.

Interviewer: So they send you observations. The observations are
Knowledge, or are Information.

Participant: Pretty nebulous. Handwavy stuff. Some as good as gold.

Interviewer: Is there a flow from noun 129 back to the position 90s?
Participant: Yes. There probably are many. But again, it’s limited to the
ones that you talk to. And it’s, for me, trying to “this is the next level
down of telling the story” of why, why do these things happen? hang on
fellas, that’s not the way it works, this is it. Some of them? [company] ...

??? Interesting story, giving a presentation. This was a few years ago. It
was noun 131s. These things are like big bowls. So we’re doing a formal
presentation, there’s about half a dozen, a position 106 from here... I
start giving this background of noun 131s. And this guy says: “[name],
what you’re really saying, independant of type of noun 61, they all form

for the same reason” and I say “spot on.” Did group 130 get that? no.

But one of the position 90s picked it up in 5 minutes of me talking. And
so, that was a formal feedback to the position 90s, but when I go back,
there’s a lot of informal value in the corridor. noun 131s is all about
this. Noun 21 noun 132 is all about this. noun 137 is about this. So, for
me personally, there is an informal feedback.

Interviewer: So there’s feedback back, whether it’s formal or informal,
it takes about the same form?
Participant: Yes. Just talking. Just start drawing lines on a whiteboard.

Putting together the pieces of the jigsaw puzzle into some sort of digestable ... my job is to tell a story. The complexity of that story depends
on the audience.

Interviewer: Would you say the feedback is Data, Information, Knowledge, or other?
Participant: It’s my Knowledge, but I’m giving it back as Information.

Interviewer: Let’s unpack that. Would you say the flow is absolutely
generated from your Knowledge, and you assert that they percieve the
flow as Information?
Participant: Yes.

Interviewer: Would you say the flow itself is a flow of Knowledge, or a
flow of Information?
Participant: Put the two together I’d say.

Interviewer: Why?
Participant: Because the Knowledge base that I’m drawing on, is much
more substantial than these.

Interviewer: So you’re passing them Knowledge, but that they accept
as Information?
Participant: Yes.

Interviewer: What do they do with that Information?
Participant: They probably stew about it. Would they incoproate that
into their actions? No.

Interviewer: Which is why you would categorize it as Information?
Participant: Yes. BEcause I have no power to direct which way they
want to noun 97. That would hopefully be operating through the form
of noun 88. My role in that loop is to just give them the background
why? They might agetate for that, “But [name] says this.” But [name]
doesn’t have a clue. Every now and then, if it’s the right sort of segment,
they will push that in.

Interviewer: So you would say that it’s not so much a flow of Information and Knowledge, as that it comes from you as a Knowledge flow,
and then becomes an Information flow they accept. ... Are there other
flows between these two entities?

Participant: in the example I’m thinking about, no. Because I’m here
as the blowing consultant. You’re hoping that the formal loop of noun
88 would be reinforcing that message. That would be from this entitiy
up to the noun 88 entitiy.

Interviewer: What do we want to label that as?
Participant: noun 88? This is the group that sets the operational procedures and standards. This is how you shoot this wheel into that position.

You will run this noun 97 at this speed. You will do this if the noun
132 in the Noun 21 exceeds this value. That’s the formal bit. So, what
I provide to them is the written report which is Knowledge, I would
suspect.

Interviewer: So there’s a flow from you to them, of Knowledge.

Participant: Formal Knowledge. This is documented.

Interviewer: So you would categorize it as a different kind of Knowledge?
Participant: Yes. This is the next level up in technical understanding.

Interviewer: This formal Knowledge flow... what’s the content of the
flow? Just as the content of this is observations.

Participant: This will be Dsets, analysis, and some observational material that supports it. This is really about the formal Data set.

Interviewer: So you’re passing to noun 88, the distilled version...

Participant: you probably do release your Data sets. There will be tables
and numbers. If it’s an analysis, there will be a table of numbers.

Interviewer: But this is your interpreted noun 97, refined...

Participant: This is my certified... Data set. I believe the Data set that
best and most reliably represents the analyses that we’ve taken as part
of this. Simple things like the tables add up to a sensitive number. If
you look at noun 133 analyses, the table is not necessarily 100
Interviewer: But they’re certified, because...

Participant: They fit more or less intenral guidelines that you have for
quality of Data. If it’s outside, there’s something wrong with it. I’ve
gotten analyses out of there that only total 70
Interviewer: Where do you get the Data for this certified Data set?
Participant: From noun 37 and analyses.

Interviewer: In the chain of entities that may provide you with this
Data set, what is the penultimate one?
Participant: For me personally, it is a physical noun 37 for which I have
an analysis.

Interviewer: So we have noun 37?
Participant: noun 37. That’s only because of how I take problems, and
the sort of problems I take. The position 134 says I want the noun 37.


The position 135 says I want the analysis. For the people here, it will
be a block of noun 97 Data. [Name]: “I’ve got two years noun 97 Data.”
I’ve got a relationship.” His noun 37 is actually the set of noun 97 Data.

And for me, occasionally, that’s probably my second set. I’ll look down
to the noun 97 Data.

Interviewer: So we’ve an entity “noun 97 Data”
Participant: Yes.

Interviewer: Do we want to say that the entity is noun 97 Data, or say
that it’s a noun 97 DB?
Participant: I’m extracting specific variables from a DB. [name], could
you get me tail Noun 23 and noun 28 chemistry? Can you get me Noun
21 noun 132s from noun 136 such and such? Can you get me the Noun
21 noun 137? can you get me the delivery noun 137 stock? That’s a DB.

Someone else will extract that for me.

Interviewer: Let’s start with noun 37. Do you send any flows to the
noun 37?
Participant: I hope not. No.

Interviewer: What flows do you get from the noun 37?
Participant: I get noun 37, observation. I see the physical nature of the
noun 37.

Interviewer: Let’s go with physical nature?
Participant: Yes. This looks like normal Noun 21 for [company.] This
stuff ’s undergoing [term]. It’s different. It shouldn’t have done this in
three days. There’s somethign about the physical nature.

Interviewer: So you’re taking physical nature. The flow of observations
of physical nature is Data,Information, Knowledge, other?
Participant: Information. But I’m using my Knowledge to assign the
Information, parameters, based on my previous experience.

Interviewer: Unpack that for me. You would say that it’s Information...

Participant: It’s Information. But that Information is actually based on
an experience and technology???.

Interviewer: Here’s a better question. You say that this Information is
a function of your prior Knowledge. Where is the input of your prior
Knowledge such that this Information is produced.

Participant: It’s my long term experience with ... Or anything for that
matter. If we went to: “What do I do with these noun 37?” First is
observation. The second is some sort of chemical analysis. And the
third thing, which i’ll come back to is what it looks like at the end of
a microscope. And one of the more or less concepts that I push to
people is that the story should be independant of scale. In the sense
that what I see down the microscope and what I see in the specimen.

Or what I see from the scanning electron microscope, they should be a
consistent story. When I write the summary those observations should

be independant of scale. They should be what I see. A lot of it is what
I see down the microscope has to match in some way, shape, or form,
what the SEM is telling me. They tell you different bits of the story, but
they must be consistent. They must be the same story. Or compatible
with the same story. And, I keep talking about what you see in textures
and materials should in some way or form, be explainable between
the two. The SEM and the optical microscope. Some people don’t see
it that way. “Oh! but this is different.” No, there the same mateirals.

How you see them may be slightly different, but the story should be
consistent. The next level down. It may not look the same, you’re
just seeing different visualizations of the same thing. That’s probably
something about the noun 37.

Interviewer: Okay, what it looks like is that physical nature and information isn’t a direct flow. That story tells me that there’s a role that
acts as an intermediary between noun 37 and noun 129. What is that
role?
Participant: That role, that’s the Knowledge role? Knowledge or expertise?
Interviewer: It’s the person making the observations. What name can
we put to that role?
Participant: I’m loathe to say. But it’s almost like an expert, it’s an
expertise I have.

Interviewer: what I see is that noun 129 sends to this role Knowledge.

Participant: yes.

Interviewer: This role gets something from the noun 37, combines it
with Knowledge, and sends physical nature as Information back into
the noun 129.

Participant: into the develoopment to write the story.

Interviewer: So we’ve got role X here ... you as noun 129 sends Knowledge to this role. This Knowledge is expertise?
Participant: Yes. Accumulated expertise which goes right back to noun
134 training in a lot of ways. Everything has a precident in the past. An
organization that forgets its past doesn’t have a future. It’s the same
thing.

Interviewer: And you get the physical nature from this entity. You as
noun 129. I’m pretty sure they’re both you. Now, this entity, we can
call it expert. Can we call it something else? What would you call it if
you were telling someone else to take noun 37 for you.

Participant: If I had pre-knowledge of what we were verb 73, I’d say look
out for.... I was just thinking that yes I had been in a situation. Usually
the critical thing is: just get me a noun 37. “Oh, oh, we’ve got the noun
37.” But that, in the industrial sense is extremely hard. Usually if you’ve
got a bit more control, you want to refine your location. The noun 138
that you’d like to take a noun 37 from. ...


Interviewer: Not just I want a noun 37, but I want a noun 37 from that
thing.

Participant: The noun 139 there. I want a noun 37 out of thatnoun
140 and I want it pretty soon... And I will go to the pile and pick it out.

“Well, that’s different, that’s different.” Because you’re almost doing the
analytical stage in your head. “Oh, we’ve got a noun 37.” and the next
question is: well wehere was it? I don’t remember. That’s part of it’s:
what is its relationship to its other entities? What was its orientation?
Is this the top or the bottom? Simple things like that. Usually in giving
guidelines for verb 73, it’s “get me a noun 37.”
Interviewer: position 141.

Participant: Yes, position 141. And usually you keep it s simple as
possible. The best option for me is get me a whole noun 37 and I’ll go
over it, and I’ll pick out the noun 37 I really need. And that’s the way I
usually work when I can. But if its ??? just get us a noun 37. And with
pictures. That’s probably the best thing. Digitial cameras are absolutely
terrific. Take a few pictures of where it’s coming from. And then go
‘I’ve got use for the things.”
Interviewer: So that means that noun 37 is sending to the position 141
something. The position 141 is also sending to noun 129 pictures.

Participant: Observations. Recorded observations that you can make
something out of. Recorded site observations. Here’s the picture. It’s
usually got a time on the bottom of it. We usually know where it’s
come from. And out of the picture you can probably scale things. “Well,
that’s usually there too...” It’s .25 mil, it’s about half a mil across. So
this digital image that’s an observation, but it’s recorded. Once you’ve
got it recorded, you’re in business.

Interviewer: This flow of recorded site observations is: Data, Information, Knowledge, other?
Participant: I’d say it would have to be Data. This is stuff you can do
things... this is something you can reduce to a number. It also has
observations, but it’s reducable to a number.

Interviewer: The noun 37 flow to position 141 is what? The position
141 is the one that uses your expertise to produce the physical nature.

So it’s taker, but it’s also the person who procsses the noun 37. So the
noun 37 to the sampe taker is what?
Participant: It’s embodied Information, isn’t it? Shoved another qualifier on the front of it. He doesn’t inherently know what it is. But the
noun 37 embodies Information. Information, it might, and if you do an
analysis on it, it’s Data.

Interviewer: So where’s the Data here?
Participant: Probably just noun 37 needs to be split into its an observation, it’s a physical noun 37, and it’s also what you do with that noun
37.


Interviewer: Let’s look at flows here. We’ve got physical
Participant: A physical body that you can hold in your hand.

Interviewer: We would say that the physical body is an embodiment of
Information?
Participant: Yes. And ultimately it can be reduced to hard numbers.

The Data.

Interviewer: That reduction of hard numbers is performed by the position 141 and given to noun 129?
Participant: Yes.

Interviewer: So we’ve got another flow here. These hard numbers,
what’s the label of it?
Participant: A chemical analysis. This chemical analysis is... this is
all hard numbers. Here is an analysis. This is real. This is hard Data.

This comes down to numbers which hopefully will ??? properly. By
standards, it’s real Data.

Interviewer: We also have other things going from the noun 37 to the
position 141, besides the physical body. Right?
Participant: Yes.

Interviewer: What are those?
Participant: Information. Simple as “this is the date I collected it, it
was raining.”
Interviewer: environmental?
Participant: environmental. It was picked off this noun 136. This noun
136, it had changed colour. It’s thats sort of observations.

Interviewer: These environmental observations are?
Participant: They’re not Data. Information?
Interviewer: As a note, don’t use exclusion. find some word that it fits
even if we have to make up new words.

Participant: I think it’s Information. it’s creating a picture of the problem.

Interviewer: Do we want to say provenance instead of envionmental
observations?
Participant: Provenance is a slightly different sort of thing.

Interviewer: Is there a flow of provenance or is provenance a function
of?
Participant: If you’re looking where other people have taken noun 37,
provenance becomes extremely important. If you know, the position
141, but there’s another position 141 out here, it’s like an expansion of
this – noun 129 request and we do have examples of this. ... position
141, then there’s a nother loop out here,... research doing things, and
they’re doing various things. And the provenance of any of their noun

37 becomes critical. Where it’s like this is the noun 37 and I’m the
position 141, provenance is not an issue because it’s embodied in the
observation. But if it was on the other side there, you’d like to know
something of the proenance of the noun 37.

Interviewer: Therefore, where’s the provenance flow? And what is it?
Participant: Provenance flow, it’s probably a subset of this interaction
here, but it is another point removed.

Interviewer: Point removed from what?
Participant: The immediatcy of the noun 37? There’s a flow there, and
it’s really Information.

Interviewer: Are there any other flows of Data, Information, Knowledge,
or other coming from the noun 37 to anyone?
Participant: No, I don’t think so. It’s all being more or less channeled
through this loop here. It’s channeling through one entity. Sometimes
this will be ircumvented because they’ll do it themselves, but really, in
the way I’m thinking about things, it’s this. This is the noun 129 role. I
take in all this Information, distill it down to a story, and pass it on.

Interviewer: Is there a flow of story here?
Participant: Usually a story back this way so they know what they’re
doing.

Interviewer: So noun 129 sends to position 141 story?
Participant: Story. Why do I want to do this? What is the background
thing? What is the rationality for doing this? This is not a stupid
exercise.

Interviewer: So noun 129 sends to position 141, rationale.

Participant: Rationale. Why are we doing this?
Interviewer: This rationale is?
Participant: It’s Knowledge. Because I know the people involved, I
know that they like to have some idea of why are we doing this? Oh,
[name] says this about it. Otherwise it’s shit. But if they understand
why, they’re likely to do it. If they don’t understand ???
Interviewer: Even if the role of position 141 is in your own head, you
still have to justify to yourself the rationale.

Participant: Why would I be spending money on this thing if it won’t
go? There’s a rationale for myself and there’s a rationalie for other
people.

Interviewer: Does the rationale go to anyone else, or is it a different
rationale that goes to other people?
Participant: The rationale heading in that direction is probably much
the same.

Interviewer: Is it the same rationale?

Participant: If you distill it down to its simplest form, yes.

Interviewer: So it’s a simplified rationale.

Participant: It’s simplified going this way, this is more detailed.

Interviewer: So noun 129 to position 141 is simplified.

Participant: I need this noun 37 because it will tell me something about
this event. I need the Data to see what’s going on.

Interviewer: Whereas noun 129 to noun 88...

Participant: It’s detailed. “These things don’t ever add up, I think
we need a noun 37, and we need this about the noun 37” Same basic
motivation, it’s got a lot more detail.

Interviewer: Are they both Knowledge?
Participant: Is gut feeling Knowledge?
Interviewer: It’s entirely up to you whether or not you want to categorize it as that.

Participant: I think it’s Knowledge, because it’s something your own
makeup that says this is valuable. It’s a form of Knowledge. It’s Knowledge. Knowledge is the sum of experience, activity, that sort of things.

“Why are we doing this? Well, in the past, this has worked. I’ve read
about this activity in the paper. I’ve put 2 and 2 together and this is
my rationale for doing this sort of thing. The Knowledge is the sum of
what has been successful in the past, what has been a flop, why was it
a flop, where did I go wrong? The formal learning.

Interviewer: Is learning different from experience?
Participant: That’s a question for an education person. I think it is. ...

The activities you’ve engaged in, previous experience, experimental
sort of things. Learning, And what you’ve seen other people do.

Interviewer: What would that be?
Participant: It would be an observation. You’ve seen them doing this,
and “jeeze, it worked. I’ll try that.” This is probably not out of the
textbook, either.

...

Interviewer: We have the noun 97 DB over here. It looks awful lonely.

Who plays with the noun 97 database?
Participant: noun 88...

Interviewer: noun 88 to noun 97 database... does what?
Participant: They, in my vision of things, they check the integrity of
the Data that is actually going into the DB. In the sense that we’ve had
a little bit of yesterday’s noun 97 Information. That point’s not right.

Something’s gone wrong there. There’s some sort of quality review of
the material that has actually long-term resident in the DB.


Interviewer: In that case, we have a flow... let’s start with the first flow
of: stuff goes into the noun 97 database. From where?
Participant: [list of redacted terms] ... the whole infrastructure. Computers, ... servers. And probably another aside to think about over my
working life, there’s been a very distinct change in the perception of
those sorts of measurements. In the sense of – when I did my noun
91, measurements were were extremely expensive to do. A noun 74
cell was an extremely expensive piece of gear. They certainly weren’t
refined in the Noun 4 precision or accuracy that we have today. And
the were extremely expensive. And you noun 95ed your experiments
effectively to extract the maximum amount of Information. Maximum
reliable Information from experimentation. That’s probably what I’d
go on with. That’s part of the Knowledge DB. This is the experience,
this ???. Nowdays, because a Noun 4, a DP setting you can get it for a
thousand bucks. To wire it into the computer is another thousand. So
two grand for a point. Ah, we’ll go for more Data. You see noun 60s
instead of 20 years ago, you might have a thousand points in a noun
60, now you might have twenty thousand. Y’know, we’ve got all this
Data, but you think “are we doing anything with it?” One of my [old]
jobs [somewhere else] was condition monitoring and melting. “When
are we actually getting to the refracteries? When are they going to
fire?” So they put in a condition monitoring system. My argument was
always: “You need to watch this data ??? times ago, it’s your best Data.”
“Oh, no, no, we’ve got in a conditioning monitoring system. “ That was
the group 130. “And we can measure the Data.” But no one looks at it.

To me we have this philosophy, oh we’ll just measure everything and
hope that the analysis just trickles out some sort of sense. Whereas I
come from an era where you noun 95 the experiment and you have a
good idea of how you’re going to extract it. You don’t really much else.

It’s planning. You see that, we keep adding more and more noun 97
Noun 4. And you ask the question of [other company], “what are you
going to do with this?” “Something.” noun 88:”We might have a look
at this thing.” but in the context of the whole operating campaign or
at least the last year, you don’t know the reliability of the Information,
you don’t see the built in trends, and you’re probably shooting in the
dark. But you’ve got the Data points. Three quarters of the Data in the
DB, you don’t know how it was [collected]. Just a change in the way
businesses perceive things now. But we’ve got this and we’ve got that.

But you’ve got to be actively worrying the Data. Pulling out the stories,
making sense of it. And it’s a little bit upsetting, but that’s the nature
of the game. You’d probably hear much of the same story from [name].

Who: “Oh, we’ll go back and have a look at the D” Uhhh. You’ve got
to start sorting it. They’re trying to make the stories out of the Data.

Wheras, me, coming here, would probably noun 95 the concept for the
system and how we’re going to extract the Data, what we want to do
with it, and you start from times of your own. The focus is on getting
the position 58ing, and once the position 58ing’s there, we’ll be right.

No, no, it doesn’t quite work that way.

...


Interviewer: The noun 60, Noun 4, and infrastructure send to the noun
97 DB...

Participant: Data. This is hard numbers.

Interviewer: This Data, these hard numbers, do we have a label?
Participant: noun 97 variables. This is a measurement of Noun 12, or
noun 74, or flow, or concentrate.

Interviewer: Some variable of the noun 97. These noun 97 variables,
they go into the noun 97 DB. Does anything else, in a general sense, go
into the noun 97 database?
Participant: There are probably operational items which do go in. Probably from switches, more than anything else. Start a cast. A binary
noun 111, it’s on or off. Bang, that was the commencement of casting.

Interviewer: Switches send to the noun 97 DB what?
Participant: Status Information. Casting, not casting. Power on, power
off.

Interviewer: Is this flow of status Information, Data, Information, or
Knowledge?
Participant: probably Data and Information. Some of it are numbers
like ladle weight for instance. That’s a hard number. Start a cast, end
a cast, that sort of thing is Information. It’s on or it’s off. It’s going to
be a combination of hard numerical stuff, quantities, masses. And the
Information is we are in this state, we are not in this state. It’s just, tick
when we’re not casting, not running noun 28. And probably how many
bowls of noun 28. That will probably be matched up with hard Data. In
the sense that there will probably be a chemical analysis.

Interviewer: noun 97 variables or something different?
Participant: Something different.

Interviewer: Where is the chemical analysis here?
Participant: It’s probably another one of these noun 37.

Interviewer: From noun 37 to noun 97 DB?
Participant: Yes. Via the laboratory.

Interviewer: So we’ve got noun 37 to lab. And we’ve got lab to noun 97
database?
Participant: Yes. And that doesn’t come through this loop, it’s a completely different loop. It’s another group of position 90s out there.

Interviewer: And they just input their things into the DB.

Participant: Yeah, they’ll have “we’ve sent the noun 37 to the lab, this
is its number, bang blam bang.” All that is not observational, the noun
37 is a physical entity, the Data that comes from that noun 37 is Data.

There’s no observation.

Interviewer: noun 37 to lab, this flow?

Participant: is a physical noun 37.

Interviewer: Would you say the physical noun 37 embodies anything?
Participant: It embodies Knowledge. It embodies the actual checmial
compisition.

Interviewer: And that, you would say, is Knowledge?
Participant: That’s Knowledge.

Interviewer: So there’s a flow of Knowledge from the noun 37 to the
lab
Participant: Yeah, in the third prty. The noun 37 inherently contains
Knowledge. Or is it Data?
Interviewer: You tell me.

Participant: Data. It’s Data. That will come down as a hard analysis and
stuff.

Interviewer: The noun 37 to the lab sends Data. The label for this Data
is?
Participant: Physical noun 37. And it embodies Data, hard numbers.

Interviewer: Versus the physical body to the position 141 which embodies Information.

Participant: Information, yeah.

Interviewer: The lab takes this physical noun 37, the data flow of physical noun 37,
Participant: Is extracted by the lab, and the lab sends to the noun 97
DB, the embodied Data.

Interviewer: Is it a data flow?
Participant: I’d say it’s Data flow. They’re not doing anything with it.

It spits out of the noun 133 or the the spark. Bang, how much of these.

No one makes an interpretation, it’ just a string of numbers.

Interviewer: The lab sends Data to the noun 97 DB of what label?
Participant: noun 37 chemistry.

Interviewer: The noun 97 DB takes these three things in, are there any
other major components that it takes in.

Participant: Apart from the time, no.

Interviewer: Time. Does it take in time from something different?
Participant: It is probably a timing against its own timestamp. When
something arrives, noun 97 Information, it arrived at this time. A clock
entity. 24 hour clock starting at midnight, standard noun 97. Anything
happens, it starts at midnight. Why? that’s 00:00.

Interviewer: The clock sends to the noun 97 DB a timestamp.

Participant: Data.


Interviewer: noun 97 DB. Now there’s interaction between noun 88 and
noun 97 DB. The noun 97 DB sends to control, what?
Participant: DB sends to noun 88 Data. It is interrogted and it downloads
number streams.

Interviewer: So it sends a flow of Data to noun 88 of what?
Participant: Numerical Information. noun 97 variable values.

Interviewer: What do we want to label that flow?
Participant: I would say Data.

Interviewer: So it’s a Data flow of Data?
Participant: You’re getting me confused. It’s a data flow of hard numerical Information against predefined variables. So this is a ??? it’s its
value.

Interviewer: Do we have a more pithy name than hard defined Information against predefined values?
Participant: Just call them noun 97 variables.

Interviewer: We have noun 97 variables here. Are these noun 97 variables different from the noun 97 variables that noun 88 gets?
Participant: No, they will be the same throughout.

Interviewer: What about all this extra stuff?
Participant: I would call that a noun 97 variable, in the sense that if
you’re doing a chemical analysis, hot metal silicon, it’s like a noun 97
variable. So they may not be instrumental values, but they would have
a defined tag to define them. And it’s a number against the tag. In the
same sense as the tag.

Interviewer: Can we put an adjective before either of these things? Like
stored or current?
Participant: The DB goes back goodness knows how many years. So it’s
effectively stored and stored for some time.

Interviewer: Do we want to say historical?
Participant: Historical.

Interviewer: Historical noun 97 variables go to noun 88.

Participant: From, from. Current time back. Then we can pull them
out, and that goes back to noun 88. And it can also be interrogated by
noun 129.

Interviewer: Therefore noun 88 and noun 129 neeed to be able to send
stuff to the noun 97 DB in order to interrogate.

Participant: Yes, that’s the program commands. I want to see this string
for this time period of these variables. It commands...

Interviewer: These program commands are?
Participant: Information requests.


Interviewer: Information requests is the category?
Participant: Yes. You send it a command and the command is to fill an
Information requirement.

Interviewer: So noun 129 and program control send an Information
request to the noun 97 DB. The noun 97 DB then sends historical noun
97 variables to both, back.

Participant: whomever’s requesting it. ... Just on here, you sketch plan
there, you’ve probably got from between ten and a hundred people
interactions. people, man-machine interactions. You’re looking at ten
people. noun 97ing, effectively on one shift, 30 people. the side loops,
we’re talking generalities, not time based.

Interviewer: What else do we have here?
Participant: I think we need a bigger sheet of paper. There’s not much
more I think you can talk about as a separate entitiy. This loop here,
there’s probably four strings to it. You can talk about noun 97 noun 37,
you can talk about raw material noun 37, but I think they all fall into
the same sort of concept. And there’s multiple streams for these sorts
of things. Probably the next step is how that comes forward and that
comes forward to the business given that they’re part of the business
, these are one step behind the business . The barriers is, you can
probably put it through there. For them, that’s the barrier. For noun
129 the barrier has come back, because you’ve got this communication
loop around here.

Interviewer: noun 88 to noun 129.

Participant: This is where it starts to get hazy. And it gets hazy. There’s
probably line group 130, which is the operational superentendant. His
Position 22s
Interviewer: Everyone who’s doing work on the line
Participant: On the line, yep. Who supervise the noun 97, who probably have a comission to see the noun 129 of the noun 97. This is the
maintnence and money. This is getting up to the dollar signs of the
business . The next one up here is group 142. This is ... line maangemangement would be [name]’s superentdenant. Raw material position
92. The group 142 would be like noun 60 general mangagers. Very very
much removed. You’ve got to summarize it for them. When you go
here, it’s a one page summary, and up to here is a one paragraph.

Interviewer: Because they’ve got so much...

Participant: They’ve got so much, and they’re distilling down...

Interviewer: Any other big big entities here?
Participant: I don’t think we’ll go as far as the shareholders.

Interviewer: They go money...

Participant: Yes, but I think there are some shareholders that care
about the businesses they invest in. I’ve invested in this business for

ethical reasons. So I’m interested in what they’re doing. Yes, money
is proabbly the root cause of it. People do carry interests about the
business, probably some of the interest is “can I get my investment out
of this?” and some of them, yes, I’ll invest in this business because of
etchial reasons. Some of the noun 129 work does filter through. This
is from experience, some of this work does filter through into annual
reports. It was greatly filtered through, I might add, but it does filter
through, and it can happen.

Interviewer: Here’s a question. Are the secretaries of any of these
bodies a different entity? Or equivalent gatekeepers?
Participant: Yes. They are usually the acess point to a lot of these
people. Especially when you get up here. And I’ve found that... my
access to [person]... the access to him is through his secretary. Because
if you go straight to him, whoosh, into the aether. Gone. No response
to any e-mail. But you ring up [name], I need to do this, “right [name],
Ok, when do you want to see [name] sometime on this day, this day, or
this day?” So there are gatekeepers for the very senior levels of group
130.

Interviewer: Are there line secretaries?
Participant: Not in the [company] organization, not in its current form.

They can make your life easy or they can make it damned difficult.

Interviewer: Flows.

Participant: There’s a big one here. This is the day to day reporting,
direction...

Interviewer: So noun 88 sends reporting to line group 130.

Participant: Yes, they report on a day by day, problem by problem basis.

Interviewer: What shall we label that as? Are there two flows?
Participant: It’s a day by day. Day reports. “And we had this problem
overnight, and this abnormal report, and I don’t know what the reason
is. And the noun 97 is ticking over. [elements] are down. We’re having
problems with the Noun 21.” It’s all that sort of Information, Data. Some
of it’s numerical, some of it’s observations.

Interviewer: So it’s Information & Data?
Participant: Information & Data. With some interpretation.

Interviewer: And the interpretation is the Information?
Participant: Probably the interpretation is Knowledge.

Interviewer: Is that a separate flow?
Participant: They’re all in the one. Because these are usually [short
term hires]. “I’m in this job for a couple of years and I don’t really
understand what I’m doing.” These blokes, these are the long term campaigners. They carry all of the sort of history, the Knowledge, what’s
been done in the past, sometimes we get it wrong. Most of the time it’s
going to be pretty right.


Interviewer: noun 88 sends the day to day reports to line group 130.

These reports are Information, Data, and Knowledge.

Participant: Yes. And a whole host of abnormal event reports.

Interviewer: Separate flow?
Participant: They’re all embodied in the day to day Information that’s
going across. What do we need to do? What are we going to get roasted
on? It’s all this mass of stuff.

Interviewer: It’s this embolism of reports. Line group 130 to noun 88?
Participant: Are usually directives. What we would like to happen.

Where do we need to push the noun 97? Why aren’t we... what’s the
situation in the Noun 21 salvage questions. And it’s directives. And in
very rare cases there may be Information coming back.

Interviewer: Directives are a flow of?
Participant: Requests, Information?
Interviewer: Information?
Participant: Information. Someone says “I want this to happen in the
... noun 60.”
Interviewer: And you say that that statement is Information?
Participant: In your classification scheme, sure. Mine would be a request. “We want you to do this. I want you to have a look at this
problem.”
Interviewer: and this is a request that is neither Data, Information, nor
Knowledge.

Participant: No, they’re requests for Information.

Interviewer: in all of this, are there any that we need to change to
match your classification scheme/
Participant: Probably only the one directing the position 141. But
remember that request comes with a rationale.

Interviewer: So which one needs to be turned into a request?
Participant: Simple rationale.

Interviewer: So that’s Knowledge and request?
Interviewer: That’s probably a request + Knowledge. “I have a reason
for asking that, but I’m asking you to get a noun 37.” Yeah, it’s a request.

You might almost say that the noun 97 database is requesting. “I’ve got
this hole in my DB, where’s the Data? Send me this number.”
Interviewer: Who is the DB requesting?
Participant: noun 97 Noun 4 or... It’ll send out flags if it....

Interviewer: So Noun 4 get a request flag?
Participant: Yep. I need a number to fill this box in the DB.


Interviewer: Fill request?
Participant: Entry request. You might also get the same from switches.

It probably is also interrogating swtiches. Switches are also effecitvely
a request.

Interviewer: This request, does it have a different label or is it the same
flow?
Participant: The same sort of flow. Say the same flow. We’re getting
too complicated.

Interviewer: Over here, day by day reports, Information+D+K. Line
group 130 sends back directives which are requests. It also sends back
questions? are they directions?
Participant: they’re questions too.

Interviewer: Is that a separate flow?
Participant: I think it probably is. “I need to know all about this.” as
distinct from “You will make sure that this is being done.” “I would like
to know about this.” slightly different.

Interviewer: These questions are Data, Information, Knowledge, Request, Other?
Participant: I’d say it’s just request. There’s probably some Knowledge
involved in making that request, but it’s not transmitted in making that
request. Because the link to here: there’s soemthing going on here that
triggers some of these requests.

Interviewer: So let’s model that.

Participant: This is starting to get... this is conjecture. Beyond the
simplistic bits here and to the developmnet, this, you can only surmise
what is going on.

Interviewer: So you believe that group 142 has a flow to line group 130,
via secretaries or direct?
Participant: Direct. Because these meet the noun 97 people, usually
once a day if not more. These people will probably have a meeting once
a week or they may do the walk around and actually go and see people.

That’s getting rarer and rarer too.

Interviewer: group 142 to line group 130, what’s the flow there?
Participant: I think there’s flows in both directions, reporting on condition, “this week we made X number of tons, our ... production rate
was such and such,” reporting. Usually about weekly is my sense. “You
can’t see him, he’s going to the weekly meeting, or gone to a business
meeting.”
Interviewer: So weekly reporting is a flow of?
Participant: Probably more Information than anything else. The Data
has dropped out of it. We’re now starting to just give the summary. Yes
it is numbers, but we’ve reduced... it’s aggregation. I’ve reduced ten

thousand individual data points into one number. All the analyses ...

and there’s probably three or four hundred analyses. “The average fill
rate was such and such. Our target was such and such. We’re below
target, we’re above target. Why? Why?” It is now Information. The Data,
the hard numerics, is gone. That number embodies the Information.

Slightly probably different sense of...

Interviewer: but it’s an important difference. group 142 to line group
130 sends what?
Participant: Probably the requests again. And the high level business
Information. Request: I want noun 143 to be instiuted in the melters.

noun 143 is a new managmenent in [company]. Basically it’s “no paper
on your desk at the end of the day.” You have a clean office, everything
in its place. Have you ever seen a technical person that isn’t mounded
up with paper? Me, I want to walk out the end of the day: “That’s where
I got to this day.”
Interviewer: It’s an external memory.

Participant: Bingo. I sit down. Alright, neurons start firing, we’re back
into it. This probably comes from the phone center approach, where
you don’t have the same desk every day. Wherever the phone is, that’s
where your job is. You have a clean desk. I think that’s where it comes
from. “You will institute noun 143 at the mine site” It’s a directive, it
comes down, it has to be done.

Interviewer: So basically what you do is you have a desk for managemnet then you have an informal paper center?
Participant: we have another place where we actually go and work.

Interviewer: High level business directives? What would you use?
Participant: Directives that are coming down from further up the pyramid. There is also the Information. That would be the business Information. Kind of the last month, we’ve broken even. We’ve made
a profit, we’ve made a loss, this has been the lossmaking area, so it’s
that etherial business Information. And the people down, once you get
beyond the line position 41. “What’s that all mean? What does it mean
on a day to day basis?” Very very hard to see.

Interviewer: This high level business Information is...

Participant: I think it’s Information. Is it Knowledge? No, I don’t think
it is. It’s just got an immediacy to it. And people who just basically
do what they’re told. The board has said this, we will do this. I don’t
care how you implement it. I want want this done. It’s Information and
requests, the Knowledge is probably very very subsidary. ...

Interviewer: Other flows?
Participant: noun 129 to, we talked about this one.

Interviewer: Are there ones besides that?
Participant: noun 129 which is where I am, yes, I do have a line to there
in the normal course of business . And in my current sort of job, I have

links to here to. Bing, bing, usually, because to see him, I’ve got to go
through [name].

Interviewer: noun 129 to position 144 sends what?
Participant: I send, it’s a distilled version of Knowledge, Information,
and Data.

Interviewer: So you send a distillation...

Participant: I send a distillation embodying all of those things.

Interviewer: Distallation of what though?
Participant: The Data. I’m telling a story about...

Interviewer: We’re going to say story.

Participant: A story, a specific problem, event, a series...

Interviewer: This story is Data + Information + Knowledge?
Participant: It’s Data, Information, and Knowledge. It’s built up from
my experience. It extracts Data, or it has a Data component, and I’m
reducing it to some sort of Information. But they’re not independant.

Interviewer: Does line group 130 send anything to you?
Participant: Yes, it also sends directives as to what it... “I like this piece
of Information, can you do more?”
Interviewer: Research directives?
Participant: Yeah. We have this problem, can you look at it? That sort
of thing. They don’t know what the solution is or what you can do
about it. “That report, can you do a photocopy of that too, and can
you send it to someone else? Has this position 41 been included in the
circulation of this?” They are, what you say, organizational directives
and directions in which way to produce investigations. “Yes, we like
that idea, can you do any more.” That’s the one you want to hear and
the one you hear the least of.

Interviewer: These organzational and research directives are...

Participant: Usually requests. And sometimes there’s Information.

Interviewer: Is it Requests + Information, or just requests?
Participant: Requests + Information but requests dominates. Requests
> Information. I think that’s a fair summary.

Interviewer: noun 129 to position 145..

Participant: is a request for an audience. “I need to talk to [name] about
such and such” or “[name] wants to see you.”
Interviewer: So they are sending back to you a request for audience as
well?
Participant: Yes.

Interviewer: So it’s a bidirectional flow.


Participant: Bidirectional, yes. But it’s only to get to see them. There’s
no Knowledge, Information, or Data, in that statement.

Interviewer: So it’s a request flow for...

Participant: a request flow for audience.

Interviewer: So it’s audience and type fo flow is reuqest. Then position
145 to group 142 send what?
Participant: They usually look at their microsoft diary and see wher
you’ve got to get.

Interviewer: So the position 145 send the position 130 their schedule.

Participant: “You’ve got a gap there, [name]” “Yeah, I suppose so.” It’s
that sort of...

Interviewer: this schedule is...

Participant: Information.

Interviewer: group 142 to noun 129 sends?
Participant: I think it’s like the position 144. It’s usually requests and
Information. Usually the Information flow is large to them. So we’re
communicating what we’re finding...

Interviewer: Findings?
Participant: Yep, yep. Where we are in the project. It’s a distallation,
it’s the story.

Interviewer: These findings are?
Participant: Primarily Information.

Interviewer: Then group 142 to you sends?
Participant: Probably requests and Information. Requests: “Look, this
looks alright, we don’t want you to do any more on that, we want you
to this.” Or, atlernatively, “Did you know that someone else is doing this
and, you really should talk to them.” So it’s a blurring of the two, but
usually, if they’re happy with which way you’re going, whether they
support it or keep going. It’s the Do/Don’t Do type...

Interviewer: So this flow is labeleld... direction?
Participant: Direction and Information. “That’s very interesting but.”
Interviewer: Direction?
Participant: Yes, Direction. And the Information is: “Have you considered this?”
Interviewer: but that’s a function of direction?
Participant: Yes “We would like you to do this.” Effectively it’s Information, but really it’s probably another form of request to do something.

Interviewer: Shareholders.


Participant: There’re so far into the aether. But really it’s feeding
through this line here. I think the Information is that way, as far as the
technical is... If you have a look at the report... you know ...

Interviewer: Report?
Participant: Annual reports. Have a look at the [company] annual
reports and you’ll see there’s a little sphiel about their technology side
of things. ... It’s part of our corporate profile and it gets a couple of
pictures. In the report it’s usually half a page. It’s saying we’re doing
these sorts of things, we’re looking at these problmes. We’re trying to
be proactive in terms of the environment. All those sorts of things.

Interviewer: Do the shareholders send anything back?
Participant: Only if the business goes bad.

Interviewer: So it’s just a one way flow.

Participant: Question, has a shareholder said anything of a technical
nature that has registered with the board? I don’t think so. Only if a
noun 97 is going really bad. ... But it’s probably only a thousandth of
a percent of what the shareholders are communicating about. Insitutional shareholders, it’s about the state of the business . But sometimes
things will pop up. But it’s only a small dotted line.

Interviewer: Technical question, concern?
Participant: Someone’s see something, someone’s asked the question.

Some of those things might be via investor relations, and you really
don’t know. But every organization has an investor relations.

Interviewer: It’s?
Participant: They’re probably trading on Knowledge,
Interviewer: So they’re sending Knowledge?
Participant: No, tehy’re using their Knowledge to generate a question/
request.

Interviewer: So therefore, it’s a request?
Participant: More a request.

Interviewer: Do we have any flows that we’re missing?
Participant: At this stage, I don’t know.

Interviewer: The sum of rationale, activities, experiences, learning, and
observation create Knowledge?
Participant: Yes.

Interviewer: Let’s have Information, Data, Knowledge, Request. What
goes into Information?
Participant: Information is, It’s the technical story. It’s usually is...

business Information, what’s the state of the business ? In a technical
sense, Information is a distallation of these entities here.

Interviewer: Therefore it distills Knowledge?

Participant: It takes Knowledge, Data, observations...

Interviewer: Is that separate from Knowledge observations?
Participant: Observations build into Knowledge.

Interviewer: So Knowledge + Data... is there a function here that turns
it into Information?
Participant: usually my brain.

Interviewer: Your brain doing?
Participant: Generating the Information is like a jigsaw puzzle.

Interviewer: You take what and combine it with what?
Participant: You take Data and Knowledge and merging the two to
generate Information. And it’s an incomplete set. These are incomplete
sets.

Interviewer: So you have Knowledge and Data create Information. Is it
equality or directionality. Can information be unsausaged?
Participant: Sometimes yes. You want to deconstruct the Information
to get back tot he original concepts. So I take this Information and plot
it. There is equality.

Interviewer: Whereas with Knowledge you take this and go.

Participant: Yep. Given that these are adding to it all the time.

Interviewer: This sigma is adding to Knowledge all the time?
Participant: Yes. I’ve found out this, and I’m going.

Interviewer: Data is?
Participant: Usually one off.

Interviewer: This, but no sigma?
Participant: Data is the hard numerical material to my way of thinking.

It’s the experimental measurements, it’s the noun 97 measurements.

It’s the chemical analyses. It’s the things that I can get which are hard.

A number which has a physical association, or a variable association. It
represents some property.

Interviewer: Does Knowledge, Information or Request have any fuction
in Data? Or is it just an experimental measurement?
Participant: It’s just the experimental measurement.

Interviewer: We have experimentaal measurements. wE combine experimental measurements with Knowledge to create Information. We
have these perceptive things which are aggregated to create Knowledge.

Participant: Yes. And the request is “We want you to look at these
things.” The request brings into play all those factors.

Interviewer: So a request is a one way function of Information, Data,
and Knowledge?

Participant: Yes. You are asked, or you ask yourself, “I would like to
know about this.” And then the higher factors come into play. “How do I
get an answer out of this problem? “and it’s the jigsaw puzzle. Consider
a 500 piece jigsaw puzzle. For most of our games, we’re making the story
on about 25 pieces of Information. In a really really good situation we
might have 100 pieces to actually put the story toghether. But usually,
because it’s in a business nature, we’ve only got 5
Interviewer: Woudl you say that this accurately corresponds to what
you consider the ontology of Data, Information, and Knowledge?
Participant: I think it’s pretty close.


8 Personal Reflections
This chapter presents an the analysis of the evidence gathered by my interviews and
surveys. I will explore whether or not my methodologies have demonstrated different
conceptions of data and if they are capable of exploring unique realities of data in the
first place.

The initial discussion is an examination of my research paradigm and approaches,
looking at the philosophical basis of my conclusions. I employ an abductive * approach
to iteratively define universes of interest, rather than applying inductive or deductive
approaches.

I am testing two questions of interest, which guide the course of my analysis:
whether people have different realities of data and whether my methodologies can
discover someone’s personal construction of data. By guiding the abductive research
process with these two questions of interest, I may be able to limit my conclusions to the
most simple and credible story possible from the evidence.

Using the questions of interest as a guide, I will iterate over the results of a recursive
analysis of every interview and survey, looking for evidence of different conceptions
of data by looking at their statements about data and the relationships they suggest
between data and information and data and knowledge. The evidence suggests that I
have successfully answered both questions of interest by demonstrating the existence of
three realities of data that emerge from both the surveys and the interviews. The success
*

An abductive research strategy features a process of rapid hypothesis formation based on inconclusive
evidence. While this shares similarities to the inductive strategy, the approach looks more to suggest
boundaries to a region of possible answers and less towards finding (inducing) the governing rule of all
the data collected. It is the approach used when there is insufficient evidence to even start guessing [56
and 57].


of this research suggests that my dissertation offers a foundation for future studies and
can be deemed successful.

8.3 Interviews
To avoid weasel words such as “participant seems,” every interview description will
be written in strong language with categorical statements about the nature of data, information, and knowledge. These are my observations and interpretations from what
the participants stated as refined through recursive analysis, not my own philosophies.

Further testing is required before these statements can be codified into any kind of
statement covering many people’s constructions of data. As one of the end products

of my methodologies is a person-specific understanding for the interviewer to the participant, I feel that these analyses will capture that specific understanding and already
provide a useful tool for any designers of databases or interfaces who want to use my
methodologies.


8.3.1 Data as Communications
One of the three constructions of data is that data are encoded signs. Signs that exist on
paper or electronically are passed between humans who may then interpret those signs
as data for information or knowledge encoded into them. In this construction, data is
a technological artifact rather than something generated and manipulated by humans.

Information and knowledge are passed using data, but are not of the same fundamental
nature. The relationship is a container metaphor rather than hierarchical.

The few interviews expounding upon this construction suggest that significant
research is necessary to explore its tenets. Beyond that, there is some evidence that this
construction may be held as a secondary way of understanding data when dealing with
technological systems * rather than as a fully-fledged construction of data of its own.

The first interview I conducted was a technical pilot, assessing the methodology alone without exploring business specific concepts. In this interview, the participant and I ex-

study. This first interview will offer the raw quotes, as well as the recursive analysis
appropriate to the section in which the quote appears, thanks to explicit permission by
participant.

Data, information, and knowledge relate to each other. Data is a menial category between these three. Data exists only as itself, without reliance on anything else. “Anything
else” here means external signs which frame, or contextualize, data as well as indications
that the data requires judgment or discernment on the part of the recipient. I believe
that the participant considers the application of context to be something required of
ambiguity or importance, and therefore of increased importance.

Data is not a function of expertise or knowledge. A critical component of data is
its lack of necessary arbitration: data is intuitively obvious, objective, and unimportant.

Participant: It’s almost like discrete packets.

Interviewer: So, packets of?
Participant: Data?
Interviewer: Commands?
Participant: Like a command. Saying: “I want to do something. I want
rez the fort now.”
Interviewer: So is it OK to label this as commands, or does it encompass
something other than commands?
Participant: It does, sometimes...

Interviewer: So commands and..

Participant: No, that’s true. It’s pretty much just commands. Like I
would send it I could do many things but they’re all related to telling
the game to do something. I don’t call it knowledge, because it’s like
it’s just, maybe they’re just talking about context thing. It’s something
fairly simple, discrete. It’s not open for arbitration or anything like
that. It doesn’t require arbitration, just “do it.”

Two iterations of analysis produce:
Data is discrete. Data does not need context nor arbitration. Commands
to software are data. Data is simple, it can be executed on its own merits.


For example, instructions for action are data, both those that are explicit instructions to software agents and implicit orders as “status updates.” In the game sense, a

status update is a message sent out from administrators to the players “advising them”
on the status of the structure players are defending. This “advice,” however, is intended
primarily as a mobilization for action, as positive activity is needed to create the structure.

Communications are information. Communications are movements of subjective
statements about the world encoded in the transmitted signs. Communications must
have context. This categorization of data is used to delineate between communication/
information and data. Beyond a generalized context, communications must also contain
a temporal context: they have to be about somewhen, whatever other elements they
contain.

Participant: So I’m telling them, I’m sending them information. That
they can now war. That they can start.

Interviewer: And so this is a what? Is this a status, is this a command,
is this something else?
Participant: It’s information because it does require context. But it’s
like a status it’s saying: “You can now war.” We can start fighting.


Two iterations produce:
Information can be returned by software. Status is a form of information. There is a temporal aspect to changes in status.

Information requires context. Information provides options.


Expertise is knowledge, being the perception of options for action in information.

Knowledge confers the ability to be persuaded by communications as expertise is used
to frame incoming information and thereby “understand” it.

Participant: I don’t know how to class their opinions. Not necessarily
knowledge. It’s almost like data. It’s like, they don’t really send me
commands, not as in the concept that we talked about, commands in
the past that do something. It’s almost like data. They just tell me
stuff. I’ll say, “We’re going to do this.” but they’ll say, “I think we should
do this.” I don’t think I have to reply to it. It’s like they’re offering
their opinion. But it’s where we’re distinguishing the different status.

And then when we go to active clan masters. Now there’s a number of
different inputs: “Clan status, Info, FB.” Same with all of these. They’re
in a group, they’re getting the same as everyone else. But we’ll have an

extra line which will definitely be MSN as well ... which will be another
input to them.

Interviewer: So you’re sending them MSN? And what are you sending
over MSN?
Participant: I don’t know? I can call it anything, can’t I? It’s like knowledge? I guess? It really is knowledge that I’m sending back to them that
way. Similarly, they’ll send me back data and opinions via FB messaging.

But they’ll also have that subsequent line via MSN. It’s that knowledge
sharing. Even hilariously in the past, I’ve actually called some of these
guys on the phone. ...

Interviewer: Now what are you doing over this MSN & Phone?
Participant: Well, that’s the genuine sharing of knowledge. Knowledge
of: “I think this; I want to do this; no, no, no, we can’t do that.” It’s a
collaborative sort of working together. It’s a sort of consensus-building.

That’s where it’s knowledge, because by sharing that knowledge you
can build a common consensus which we can work around. Because if
we don’t share each other’s opinions or experiences then we never build
the consensus to actually operate, otherwise you’d just be individuals
because it, generally as a clan, we have to come up with a consensual
view of everything..

Interviewer: Do we want to have consensus as another line? Or is the
sharing consensus-forming?
Participant: Yeah, the sharing is consensus-forming. We exchange
knowledge and out of that comes consensus. Even that knowledge is:
“Do you consent to this?” It’s not really a command but it’s a knowledge.


Two iterations produce:
Opinions, lacking privileged status, are not knowledge. Activity provides context. Responses from active members are classified as knowledge. Responses from semi-active and inactive leaders are data through
opinions.

Knowledge can be shared. Collaboratively sharing knowledge builds
consensus.


There is no explicit differentiation between different kinds of data. There are
examples in which data is either technical in nature (for example, a command to cause
activity) or a communicative activity (wherein the communication was not produced as a
function of expertise). Data is interesting only in the sense that it represents the mental
activity of the communicator, not as any kind of thing on which to take action. The

differentiation only extends to the comment that something is “sort of data” potentially
representing an internal cognitive dissonance between the two ideas.

Participant: It’s when you’re talking to another person and they’re passing their knowledge of what happened to them and what happened in
the past to you. So you can either learn from your own experience or
other’s experience. It’s really a mixture of that. In relation to knowledge gathering.

Interviewer: Would you say that there’s any relationship between
knowledge and data in this sense? Or is it just...

Participant: No, I don’t... I think. I think the expression of data in this
context, it’s interesting actually. Now you’ve got me thinking. No, but
yes. Yes, but no. Well, it is sort of, yes. I agree. I don’t often express
some things like certain relations to [the game] as data. but there
definitely is if you stop and think about it, because. But yes.


Two iterations produce:
Knowledge can be gained from talking to other people, learning things
through the game. Experiential Knowledge is what you get from doing
things. You learn from criticism, experimentation, failure. A different
kind of knowledge is someone else’s experience. Knowledge is privileged over data. Represents “knowing” over "observation.


There was no discussion on transformations of data. Moreover, no conclusions can
be drawn from inference, as it is equally likely that no transformative framework exists
such that the standard hierarchy is present. Each term seemed to be discussed on its own
merits without reference to the others. There are two constructions of data found here:
data as a menial-interpersonal communication and data as a menial-technical communication. In both senses, data contains no privilege over information or knowledge. As
menial-technical, data seems to be considered to be bits or human instructions rendered
as bits: self-encapsulating orders for action. As menial-interpersonal, data seems to

be expressed observations of the world without a knowledge basis: empty words to be
corrected and brought in line with the consensus formed by more experienced people.


8.3.1.2 Interview II
The participant is an information worker.

Data is a container for human-produced information. Data is the only thing manipulable by machines. Information and Knowledge
cannot be transformed into Data, only contained.


The participant works with information systems. Data is a
container for human-produced information. Information
and knowledge relate to each other as a function of human
interpretation, integration, and analysis. The main function
of data is as a communicative medium of technology.


There is no hierarchy or relationship between data and information. Data is completely different from information or knowledge.

Data does not belong in the hierarchy of Information or Knowledge.

The results of a search are Knowledge, but are formatted and contained
within Data.


These quotes indicate a strong differentiation between information/knowledge
and a strongly physicalized data. Although information and knowledge are related, the
relationship expressed seems to be a function of analysis and encoding.

Communications between people, as discussed in the interview, are clearly information.

Information is non-physical. It can be a communication, a conversation,
a story.


Knowledge, or personal experience, is encoded in information for transmission to
other people. This ontology requires this encoding because knowledge is not directly
communicable between people. Knowledge guides interpretation of information and, in
the case of knowledge encoded in information, the recipient’s knowledge must be used
to analyze the incoming information-communication to produce new knowledge:

Knowledge is associated with an experience. Information doesn’t have
to be read or analyzed. Knowledge must be analyzed and used.


Data is a container for human-produced information stored in physicalized entities
such as books or computers:
Data is a record that can record and contain Information. Records, Data,
are merely physical entities.


As examples of data, the participant offers: “Physical containers are pieces of paper
or e-mail. Digital containers are still physical.” With no evidence for other interpretations.

In a simple sense, the participant believes that: “Data is a bucket for Information and
Knowledge.” To restate: data is a semiotic representation of and container for content.

Data as semiotic container is a strong ontological stake. It expands beyond the
simple data-as-bits construction that may accompany other realities of “real” or “raw”
data. The universal application of data-as-container and information as root-of-meaning
suggests that this construction extends beyond a simple communicative reality that can
be used in conjunction with other constructions. Rather, it strictly defines a role for
data in the storage of signs and relegates it to a strictly supportive role with respect to
meaning. Nor does this construction leave any room for data as observation or numerical
representation.


8.3.2 Data as Subjective Observations
The next interviews explore the nature of data as a subjective observation. These constructions differ strikingly from the data-as-communications realities as they accord
data a place in the knowledge/information/data hierarchy. There is evidence of Ackoff’s
hierarchy in interview III that contrasts with a more cyclic hierarchy in interview IV.

Present in both interviews is the acknowledgment that data is inherently subjective,
that it is produced from observations made by people, and that it must be contextualized

with information to provide useful guidance. Data’s lack of inherent value due to its
subjectivity requires that it be “filtered” so that only the most usable aspects remain.


8.3.2.1 Interview III
The participant explored business dynamics
of a meeting. Data is the basis of information and knowledge, and formed from observations.


This interview, exploring the interactions of a meeting, was
one of my more theoretical interviews. While most of the
other interviews focused on more technical topics, the communicative/business focus of this discussion provided an

interesting counterpoint to the other interviews featured in the rest of this analysis. Observation is the fundamental component of data, allowing interpreted data to be useful
information. Information becomes knowledge, with the hierarchy continuing beyond
knowledge:
Knowledge is probably not the top of the hierarchy. Universal truths,
e.g. things called “Laws” in science, could be called wisdom (W).


In the interview, the participant began with a discussion of their opinion of the
relationships between data, information, and knowledge. Later in the interview, however,
they admitted to a change of their preconceptions due to the interview: “I consider [data
and information] to be a hierarchy, but it’s not very clear in my mind” is a comment
made by participant at the start of the interview. Later in the interview, the participant
observed that participation in the SDFNproduced a change of understanding of data:
Coming into this interview, I thought that the hierarchy was Data, Information, Knowledge with maybe Wisdom or something above that. Or
something crazy like that. Way out there. During the meeting, I think
I... with your... non-directional coaching, you helped me to see where
things were probably Data, where those Data were used by others to
form Information. And then, pieces of Information, there’s something
higher above information.


Structured and organized data, as delivered for a persuasive argument, becomes in-

formation. Data can be transformed into knowledge directly, such as a scientist predicting
movement with Newton’s first law of motion. In a prediction of the future as information,
the predictor has to take data (observations of something happening), and input them
into knowledge (a scientific model). Interestingly, data also encodes information and
knowledge as well as forming the basis of those two concepts.

Knowledge is the theoretical basis of understanding-of-the-world. Two people discussing a simple mechanical operation are communicating information, but the theory
driving that discussion is knowledge. Furthermore, the jargon used in that discussion
also represents knowledge, whereas a generalized description is “somewhere between
data and information.” Thus, an understanding of the state of the art and the status quo
is knowledge of what is possible or effective to do. Operation of effective management
practices is also knowledge, despite the management theories themselves not being
transmitted. Because the knowledge of effective management inspired the communications to modify behavior, the communications themselves are knowledge, representing
the practice of those theories.

Information is data structured for a purpose. Structured, organized data as delivered for a persuasive argument becomes information just as an historical-relationship
context is also information structured for purpose. Data becomes information by a person
or machine collecting data and then “drawing something out of it.” Just as information
is a structuring of data, the participant suggests that knowledge may be a structuring of
information.

Data is an observation. A listing of daily events is a data flow just as a progress
update is data. Nonverbal cues between people across a meeting table, such as eye contact
or arm movement, also constitute data. When one of the meeting participants aggregates
the nonverbal cues to supplement persuasive mechanisms, the participant considers

that aggregation to be data.

Another example of data is an intuitive insight, a “moment of clarity,” into the fundamental nature of a problem. “Data gathering” is used in the context of an experiment
differently than the term “data” alone, with few relationships in common between the
two. “Experimental data”, unlike normal “data”, can have different levels of quality: “we
can classify the data better if we can see it clearer.” There seems to be little support for
data as encoded information or knowledge.

The resolution of cognitive dissonance in this interview suggests that the SDFN can
be used as a way to reconcile a participant’s theoretical understandings of categories with
their everyday use. This consequence, while useful in the exploration of philosophy, can
also be useful as a practical way to resolve “silos” as it is a way to change a participant’s
understanding of the items under discussion.


8.3.2.2 Interview IV
The participant is an engineer. Data are
subjective observations ﬁltered by knowledge
and localized into information.


This participant engaged in multiple interviews, producing
quite a lot of evidence and strong elaboration of their ideas.

There is a cyclic hierarchy of data as observations, localized

by information, and filtered by knowledge, becoming information and knowledge. Knowledge then directs the gathering of the next cycle of information. There are no obvious
demographic characteristics to explain the strong subjective nature of this participant’s
views, though they seemed to engage more strongly with databases than did those of
some of the other participants.

Data is used both in singular and plural senses, data can have qualities, and measurement generates a data point. Data relates to information and knowledge in a cyclic

hierarchy *, such that some assertions about the world (knowledge) form a context within
which to view data. “Knowledge filters data, which produces information, which produces knowledge. The acceptance of new knowledge is predicated on extant filters.”
One example of context modulating the nature of data is the understanding of a
sensor’s purpose changing the observer’s interpretation of the data produced by that
sensor. In this understanding, background education is a primary contributor to a piece
of data’s context.

Information’s localization of data from the “study of the issue at hand” helps the
recipient to understand what the data means. Information emerges from a contextualization of data: “In order to have context [within] which to understand data, background
education (knowledge) and the study of the problem at hand (information) must be combined.” Knowledge and information represent different levels of understanding, with
knowledge formed by integrated conclusions versus the ordered and contextualized data
of information.

Understanding in this case is an awareness of applicability. All data, information,
and knowledge interact with mental models of the worlds. Locally true items are information, whereas knowledge informs models that are more global. Because the generation
of knowledge is a function of incoming filtered data, we sometimes get conflicts in explanations:
Explanation is contextualizing [models] for specific circumstances. Explanations should expand knowledge. Sometimes they contradict understanding, potentially due to cultural factors or mistranslation.


Knowledge filters for meaningful data, and data is contextualized from information
into information. Contextualizing knowledge frameworks allow for an understanding
of incoming data by situating that data within knowledge. The framework does so by
*

providing a relevancy filter for incoming data:
Information is more concrete – in the hierarchy. Data is concrete. I measured it via a defined process at a particular time. We might argue what
it means, which is knowledge, but it is what it is. But the information
... I’ve reviewed a whole pile of things. Those are information sources,
it’s clear how I obtained them. They may be wrong, their provenance
may not be certain. Data is specific, discrete. Information can be a
collection of data.


It is the process of collecting and localizing data which turns data into information.

This set of localized data is contextualized, which increases relevance at the same time
that it increases potential error or subjectivity. Despite claims of concrete data, data in
this construction must be subjective: it is filtered from human observations. However,
the self-reflection of that subjectivity creates meta-data about reliability and thereby
filters for useful data.

Data is a discrete observation. Discrete data means the ability to specify “what,
where, when: would define a piece of that, what the measure of it was, and its location
at the time.” Data has a specific provenance and reliability. Data is treated as if it is
atomic, despite the ability to perform different, closer observations of the same thing.

The presence of the term “filter,” one of the most important keywords that I found,
suggests that data as observation is produced from any observation of the world and is
thus a subjective construction, tied to the observer, rather than evidence of the world.

Meaning is produced through the negative feedback of knowledge. Data can be
formed into data sets, which may be evidence of a somewhat local scientific language
translating between purely subjective data and the “reliable” data that some scientists
demand. Relationships between sets are information.

There is no link to technical data in this construction. Representations of data
(bits) are not the thing. Categories of representations are meta-data and bit streams are
merely representations of data. “When people can attach meaning to bit-streams, they

can become information. Normally glyphs become information, but when they’re just
representations of data (like the ’A’ signifying a part of the base pair in DNA) they’re still
data.”

8.3.3 Data as Facts
Conceptions of data in this category tend to be more scientifically oriented, representing
data as only the results of careful consideration and measurement. Here, data as facts
orient the observer to a recorder-of-measurements, rather than as someone who must
filter observations or interpret semiotic encodings.

This category of interviews is the largest, as can be expected while interviewing
a scientific research establishment; because of the scope of the interviews, I probably
missed some significant nuances. Exploring the different constructions of data and fact
from a philosophy of science standpoint could be extremely productive.


8.3.3.1 Interview V
In strong similarity to Interview I, the participant differentiates between what can be understood by consciousness and
what is in the realm of machines. The participant is a highly

The participant is a scientist. Data are measured observations, objective reﬂections of
the world. Information is a product of human
thought to contextualize that data.


theoretical researcher, in contrast with some of the more
pragmatically trained participants. Data are specific and measured observations.

Data, information, and knowledge are ordered categorically in terms of precision.

Information is an unconfirmed interpretation of data and knowledge represents understanding of the real world. The flow from specific to general is interesting, especially
when considering the implications of the participant’s conception of data.


Data are measured observations, with observations or raw measurements as “raw
data,” and interpretations of data to be data-as-“interpreted data.” Experiments return
data as numbers collected by various instruments, but data is also embodied in the world.

Geometry and design of equipment and the operational set points are data. “Equipment
geometry and operational set points are embodied data.” The idea of data embodied in
the real is a strong feature of the data-as-facts construction.

There must be an observer to manipulate things outside of data because, “[The]
experiment itself is not a conscious entity; you cannot send anything but data to it.” While
it is interesting to consider information and knowledge as functions of consciousness,
the distinction between data as embodied or observed seems to belie my assessment
of “data as measured observations.” If data is allowed to be embodied in the physical
universe, then to retrieve the data and thereby to understand the object is to perform
some sort of structured and measured observation in the context of an experiment. The
participant notes that data are “raw numbers and no context.” This construction requires
that data must be understood as the fundamental relationships of matter that can be
observed and quantized.

The category of information trades precision for context. Information is an unconfirmed interpretation of data. There is a clear distinction between the objectivity of data
and the interpretation/necessary subjectivity of information.

It’s not just raw numbers ... but it’s not knowledge because it’s the
experiment and a very contrived environment.... It is interpreted data
about the contrived environment.


This interpreted data-as-information is not knowledge because it does not represent a phenomenon of the object under consideration. Data produced as part of a simple
experiment, does not form the basis of action in the real metalworking area.

Experimental information (or interpreted data) as the product of simple experi-

ments may not conform to the real world. However, information may form the basis of
understanding of the real world. Information, combined with a statement of “I think
you should do this” (classified as knowledge) may allow design engineers to create new
designs. Flows of information wholly contain “raw data” * and its explanation, whereas
an independent flow of data would be subject to external interpretation.

Knowledge is an understanding of the real world. It may be formed from personal
experience, but may not be about “unreal things.” An unreal thing is “Information,
because it’s not a real thing yet. It’s not knowledge about a real device. It’s still a
hypothetical.”

8.3.3.2 Interview VI

interviewed. They explore the implications of computerized
data. However, in contrast with other interviewed informa-

tion workers, they clearly articulate data to be facts exported
from measuring instruments. Although there are elements of contextualization here,
the view of data as records of measurements indicates a different construction of data
when compared to the other information specialists †. More research is necessary to
explore how interactions with technical devices shape conceptions of data.

There is a strong relationship between information and knowledge:
An example of information is a time series trend. An example of knowledge is advice (expert correlates information, presents a suggested
course of action). Information can be provided to support decisionmaking. Examples of information: Train timetable, an index of crime
levels.

*
†

The use of “raw” here is a specific example of a conceptual trading zone discussed on page 32.

Contrast these results with Interview I (p. 275) and Interview IV (p. 284).


There are suggestions of a relationship between knowledge and data: “Sensors
provide data, something you can work with.” Then, information plots data versus data.

Knowledge contextualizes data (and the plot of data).

Knowledge is a generalized statement about the world. Information is multidimensional data such as data versus time. The act of contextualizing data by forming data sets
and comparing it against other parameters like time produces reports as “information.”
These reports are locally true, and may be explored for insights into trends and patterns
(knowledge).

Data produces information, which produces knowledge. Mathematical models are
information, which complement experiential knowledge. However, models are useless
without data as input. Information-as-model requires contextualization (knowledge) by
a person to be useful: “People’s experience, as knowledge, tells them when to transform
data into information into knowledge.” Thus, data is treated as if it is atomic, despite
being decomposable in other contexts.

Looking at the higher levels of the hierarchy, knowledge must be explicit and
encodable (such as into source code), but it has fewer restrictions than information
because information is less discrete. Data are components of information. People treat
“derived data” as “real” despite knowledge that it has been processed. In the local jargon
of the research environment, real seems to mean “authentic and an atomic representation
of a measurement.”
Data are measured facts. They can be input to mathematical models, contextualized with information, and generalized with knowledge. They are created from sensors
and bits. This construction clearly articulates Ackoff’s hierarchy of data, information,
and knowledge, viewing data as unimportant building blocks in the path towards gener-

alizable statements.


8.3.3.3 Interview VII
This participant is less computer-focused than those of the
prior interviews, instead investigating physical phenomena.


The participant is a scientist. Data are numbers formed from data points. Clearly articulates Ackoﬀ’s hierarchy.


Although data are also facts for participants, there exists an
entity below data: the “data point” or specific measurement. Sets of data points become
data, restricted purely to the numerical results of measurements.

Data are numbers, and only numbers. “Data is a multi-dimensional collection of
data points. A data point is a number.” As well as “Data plus analysis creates information.

Analysis is a function of a mental causal model. Understanding of the model is knowledge.” The ultimate goal of data collection is the creation of knowledge as the basis of
science.

Information is the basis of action and a container for data: “Information are instructions to perform work of a specific nature, guidance into what it is they’re going to
test.” Information is what allows humans to judge between different outcomes: to order
one product over another because of scientific results contained within the information.

Those results, interpreted and packaged, are data. Although the participant uses the
container metaphor here, information is not acting as a passive sign-repository. Rather,
the contextualization of information is explicitly differentiated from the pure numbers
of data, rather than data being transformed into information.

Data, analyzed into information, may create novel information. Novel information
can generate knowledge. Knowledge is a predictive model of the universe, “based on
generated meaning through interpreted results (information).” Knowledge as predictive

model is far superior in this hierarchy because of its generalizable quality, something
that individual decisions to act do not contain. A meta-analysis of action, the results of
acting on information received, can create meaning or knowledge:
Knowledge is a model derived from analysis of information. You analyze data and generate new information. New information can generate
new models. Models are knowledge. A shift in [a] model (physical or
whatever) is due to new knowledge from discussion.


This construction demonstrates Ackoff’s hierarchy *, with the scope increasing
as each level of abstraction is gained. Models, as the ultimate discussed step, represent
knowledge, because they represent that which interprets incoming information. At the
base of the hierarchy, however, rests data as facts measured into numbers.


8.3.3.4 Interview VIII
The participant is a researcher from a diﬀerent company. Data are objective observations with no restriction on representation.

Data can be generalized in Knowledge and
contained within Information.


The participant’s background is strongly different from that
of most of the other interviews, as they are not directly affiliated with the company. The interview was taken spontaneously while they were visiting the site on one of the days

I conducted interviews. Data are rendered measurements. Unlike Interview VII, the
measurements are not constrained to purely numerical entities, but require the same
level of objective rigidity.

In the interview, the participant did not discuss any hierarchy of data, information,
or knowledge. While there seem to be strong verbal differences between data and the
others, there are no transformations from data into information or knowledge. Information is understood quite differently from data or knowledge: “Information is a container
for data and knowledge.”

See page 27.


Knowledge is transmittable experience: “Knowledge is perception of something,
what you think you know.” Experience manifests as intuitions and requests for specific
data are an expression of encoded knowledge. In one example, the participant transmits
a request for an image to the database: “I would be sending that knowledge, even if the
DB doesn’t acknowledge it.” Knowledge is transmitted in the act of using knowledge,
despite the receiving components possibly not being able to understand that what they
are receiving is indeed knowledge.

Specific data retrieval is a function of knowledge. Because knowledge is present
in the act of using knowledge, data requests to computing devices are formed from
knowledge and therefore represent the sender’s knowledge, rather than the recipient’s
received data. This represents an interesting meta-component of this conception of data,
representing an explicit trading zone formed between entities sharing what one of them
considers to be data.

Information is a container. Bits are information and form the substance of the
container. Beyond the container metaphor is also a question of quality:
Information is a quality. It mixes with data and knowledge. Something
that you relate, it goes from one source to another. Any kind of data or
knowledge is some kind of information.


Thus, information is more than a simple container, and may seem to be an intrinsic building block of data-knowledge interaction with the world. Information seems to
equate to semiotic ideas, as it can be a representation or transmission agent. In strong
contrast to the constructions of the data-as-communication camp, information is communication. Information, being formed of signs, requires interpretation for the extraction
of the data and knowledge components of use to computers and humans, respectively.

Data are factual representations of measurements. They usually form numbers,
but, “Information is text and data is numbers, but even text could be data. Text as data

are descriptions of measurements.” The fundamental characteristic of data is that it is
the factual product of experiment. At the same time, the participant also seems to use
data-as-technical, because they describe punching in a few numbers to get a drawing as
data as well.

This interview represents a fascinating departure from the normal affordances
expressed as it provides a strong definition of data and knowledge and a very weak, subsidiary, and technical view of information. One possible explanation is that, coming from
another country’s cultural understandings, participant linked the term information to
the computerized bits and had less experience with other uses of information. This interview, alone, suggests a strong need for an international investigation into the different
cultural conceptions of data.


8.3.3.5 Interview IX
The participant is an engineer. Data are
numbers that are orderable within a list.

Source code is also considered to be data as
it is comprised of numbers and instructions
for those numbers.


The participant engaged in an interesting interview: they
produced two diagrams exploring both an academic project
and an engineering project. In both frames of thought, participant describes data as something inherently numeric,

with some basis in fact.

Data, information, and knowledge relate in a cyclic hierarchy. Data interpreted
via existing knowledge creates information. Information analyzed creates knowledge.

There is a container metaphor in this construction of data as, “Information can appear
alongside knowledge or as a component of knowledge.” As a practical example of this understanding: equipment returns data that is processed into information via an engineer.

Analysis is then performed as to “whether things are working.” Information is produced

by an analysis of data.

Knowledge is fundamentally experiential: “I would define knowledge as something
that an individual or entity... something that an entity possesses. That typically has been
learned from somewhere else or gained from experience or whatever that enables them
a better understanding then they would have otherwise.” Knowledge as understanding represents knowledge as model, articulating the nature of the universe by making
predictions about future events.

Knowledge acts as the agent that transforms data into information:
My understanding of how things would work is that knowledge is the
process by which data is turned into information. So I would say data
is things. It is numbers, it is raw information. It is something that,
on its own, doesn’t mean very much. It’s just stuff. Information is an
interpretation of that. So it’s kind of something that is understandable
to someone without knowledge, without even concept of what the raw
data is.


Knowledge is understanding: advice about the causes of unexpected events. Knowledge can be communicated and the creation of understanding of the process under
investigation is knowledge. Documentation contains knowledge because it presents a
history of actions, and can provide methods for analyzing data. The analyzed data, in
some ways the “understood data,” is collected in things like reports. The report, however,
just contains facts about what was done and the results. “[Less meaningful] stuff is the
information and the results are data.”
Data are numbers: “You can put them in a list. There is a defined quantity. They
can be grouped, they can be ordered or whatever. They probably are data. You can put
them in a spreadsheet.” However, the emphasis seems to be on numbers rather than on
scientific results: not on the objectivity but on the coding mechanism. The participant
believes that code is data: source code is instructions and numbers to work with.

Information is connected with the communicative act. Facts are transmitted via

information, but there does not seem to be any evidence to indicate that facts are information, merely that information is the semiotic encoding [58] process by which they are
communicated. Knowledge can be communicated through information. The recipient,
in possession of this encoded knowledge, must then analyze the information to retrieve
its knowledge component.

In some ways, information described in this construction echoes the information
as container construction of Interview VIII. While there is evidence of the participant’s
cyclic hierarchy, there are interesting ambiguities relating to the relationship of information, “raw information”, and facts. While data are encoded pre-facts expressed as
numbers, this interview presents difficulties in classification and represents an edge case
worthy of future research.


8.3.3.6 Interview X
The participant is a researcher external to
the company. Data is embodied in reality
and can be discovered through measurement.

Data represents the fundamental relationship of things to one another.


This interview also involved someone external to the company. Their conception of data represents something with
a strong sense of embodiment; data is physically present in
the world, in relations between matter. Measurements and

observations can discover data, but not create it out of subjective whole cloth.

One of the more interesting concepts of the interview was that of formality. The
idea of formality is raising a McLuhan-like “medium is the message” level of meta-analysis.

It notes that the context of a communication and its source within an organization
contribute significantly to the actions one takes upon it, despite the same communication
being passed from different directions: “Information passed from knowledge won’t
be turned into knowledge by the recipient due to a lack of formal power within the

organization. The information is just ‘the background why’ that doesn’t change actions.”
Formality, the coding of the “authority” encoded in the message’s medium, is
something that modulates knowledge rather than a unique category to itself. Formality
represents an actionable instance of whatever the category is. Written reports, delivered
to responsible people in the organization, are an example of formal knowledge. They
are incorporated into the organization’s stock of knowledge and acted upon. Those
same reports delivered to interested parties, informally, do not have the same actionable
qualities.

Formal knowledge is an expression and transference of technical understanding.

Components of the flow described by the participant include distilled and certified data
sets, the analysis of those sets, and other supporting observational material. The certification of the data sets is to insure that the analysis is internally consistent. Certification
is checking the fit of “internal guidelines of quality.” To designate something as certified
is to express an opinion of its reliability and repeatability. Because of the additional
process of certification, formal x can be acted upon. The participant believes that normal
flows, lacking confirmation, are not processed in the same way.

There is clear evidence for a reverse hierarchy in the interview. The Tuomi hierarchy suggests that we use knowledge to build information that allows us to extract data
from the world; this data then allows us to update our models of the world. In this way,
as information frames our requests for data (subjective or objective as they may be) it is
possible to check the integrity of the data and contextualize it by inspecting the originating information. Experiments can be designed to extract information from sensors
and computing devices operating on machinery. When sensors are rare, experiments
are designed to maximize “reliable information from an experiment.”
Knowledge is expertise. Expertise, however, is expressed as an understanding of

the world that shapes action. The participant observes that “corridor conversations”
discussed in an informal setting can contain information and knowledge. Information,
in this case, “is the things that I can reduce to something technical.” Knowledge “is their
understanding of the process, how and why they turn levers and their perception of
the basis of that.” Thus, as expertise accumulates from the past shared precedents of
actions, events, and training, it acts as a guide to action. It informs information-gathering
methodologies, which then inform data-collection strategies. The use of “reduce” in the
quote above is better understood as “abstraction” rather than implying that information
is “under” knowledge.

Information has a temporal element or has a different level of reliability. Whereas
more sensors, both cheaper and more connected, produce more data, the output of
multiple sensors over time produces information. “In the context of the whole operating
campaign, you don’t know the reliability of the information, you don’t see the built in
trends... but you’ve got the data points. Three quarters of the data in the database,
you don’t know how it was acquired.” Although information may appear to be used
synonymously with data, there is a suggestion that a thing can be classified as data or
information based on some kind of underlying or meta-characteristic.

For example, a physical sample can embody both data and information, depending to whom it is sent. This suggests that observations and numbers are latent in the
world. In this way, observation transforms latent information or data in the atomic or
molecular structure of the thing being experimented upon into more easily recognizable
numbers with defined error limits. This transformation is not an external imposition of
measurement, but a recognition of something that is already there.

Information is an observation of the world. Observations of physical nature are
information assigned from parameters informed by knowledge as previous experience.


The participant strongly believes in the objectivity of information. They require that
different types of measurements of the same object correspond. In this instance, a sample
represents embodied information. There is no inherent knowledge of what it is in the
object, but it is information. If the information is analyzed, it then can become data. In
this vein, environmental observations surrounding the sample are information, creating
a “picture of the problem.” Binary signals from switches can be information or data,
depending on whether they represent state status (information) or measurements of
quantities and masses.

The apex of the hierarchy is data. Data are contextualized hard numbers. Data
can be generated from “something you can reduce to a number. It has observations, but
it’s reducible to a number.” Optimally, samples will be accompanied by recorded site
observations, situating the sample in some sort of context.

Unlike the other interviews, this one holds no indication that contextualization
serves to transform the data into information. Instead, contextualization creates data
that are more valuable. All things contain within them latent information that, through
the correct experiments, may be observable. Only through analysis can the observed
and recorded results be promoted to data. One method of analysis is a chemical analysis
because the results of chemical analysis are deemed “real” and “hard data” numbers
according to standards.

At the same time, data has different natures according to the roles that need the
data. “The geologist says I want the sample. The chemist says I want the analysis.”
The participant notes that for other roles, data’s substance can be process data or the
discovery of relations within the set of process data.

Data exist at various levels of accuracy. “Industrial quality” data has accuracy
considerations different from those of academic or theoretical quality. Furthermore, dud

data-data that is erroneous-is possible and is a likely result of cost-saving measures.


8.3.4 Reflection Conclusion
My findings fundamentally agree with and extend both Chaim Zins’ work and the definitions of the Oxford English Dictionary. While more research is necessary, there is little
doubt in my mind that I have answered the two questions of interest:
•

I have discovered constructions of data that profoundly differ from each other and
that agree with other, related research.


•

Some evidence points to the existence of trading zones between different constructions of data. The use of the terms “raw data” and “derived data” in the interviews
strongly suggests this. However, more research is necessary before there is any useful
evidence for how trading zones form with constructions of data and what impact
evaluative accents have on data and misunderstandings.


•

There is evidence for both Ackoff’s and Tuomi’s hierarchies of data, information, and
knowledge. Ackoff’s work has penetrated modern thinking, especially management
thinking, quite deeply. At the same time, the more “modern” relativistic philosophies of science seem to correspond quite well with Tuomi’s ontology. Far more
evidence is needed to create suggested “trading zones” that can bridge these and
other discovered conceptions of data.


•

Some indications hint that the developer’s understanding of data is a factor in database design, though the current evidence cannot create useful rules for database
changes based on the recipient’s current conception of data. More implementation
research is needed here, as well.


•

Both the interviews and the surveys discovered different realities of data, but not
without failures. More research is necessary to explore the utility of my methodology
and to refine it for different purposes.


8.4 Surveys
To demonstrate that the results of the research were not a fluke of my methodology, I
then decided to run a set of surveys to explore another perspective on the reality of data.

This section documents the results of my second survey attempt and is a check on the

conclusions drawn from my interviews. Many different participants participated in this
survey, being drawn from academics, IST professionals, other workers at BlueScope, and
intelligence workers from the United States civilian and military intelligence establishments.

Survey analysis proceeds in a roughly straightforward fashion. I discuss interesting
aspects of each incoming survey, and try to derive their conception of data by looking
at how they classify data, information, and knowledge. Their classifications and the
relationships they articulate between them may give some clue about each participant’s
conceptions of data. Less time will be spent on each individual survey due to their less
comprehensive nature. The terms “participant” and the singular “they” will continue to
be used to indicate the survey-taker.

These surveys were the first deployment of my survey methodology that resulted in
any kind of success. As such, the instructions were not close to perfect, with a few surveytakers misunderstanding the instructions. I state this with certainty as one participant
(name withheld, but permission given) had the following to say in an e-mail:
Also, I had a hard time with the questions. About midway through the
survey, I realized that some of the questions were looking for a semantic
understanding of the meaning of the highlighted words. I began the
survey looking at it through an analyst’s eyes, with the understanding
that data coming in only becomes information or knowledge if it reveals
something about the intended target – usually a person or group of people (network). As I went along, I realized that you were differentiating
between data, information, and knowledge as semantic definitions that
all described different types of incoming “media” or “communications”.

I got the impression that you viewed data as something measurable,
information as something that feeds understanding, and knowledge as
something that is either factual or knowable. Since these are pretty
disparate understandings of the terminology, it was difficult to reconcile my answers between the two methods of differentiating the data
types.

I offer this as perhaps an anecdotal story about the problems with
this kind of question. Like so many issues surrounding understanding within a community (e.g., religious doctrine), the real question
here is perhaps not so much a matter of different perceptions within

a subculture, but whether or not the subculture has taken the time to
clearly define their terminology to enable effective communication.

For more “tangible” elements of conversation, like computer design,
engineering, or medicine, the subcultures tend to build a sophisticated
lexicon of industry jargon very quickly, because the objects described
(whether processes, methods, tools, concepts, or physical things) are
easy to understand. With subcultures that focus on more ambiguous
topics (freedom, truth, spirituality, goodness, guilt, culpability), the
clarity of their jargon becomes diluted by variation in understanding
of the meanings of the subculture’s terminology. You (purposely?) do
not define what information, data, and knowledge mean in your survey.

Therefore, these terms will carry a wide variety of denotations and connotations with them. The implication is that effective communication
within the intelligence subculture cannot begin until the subculture’s
definition of these terms is made explicit.


Therefore, the products of this analysis should be taken with a grain of salt, and
used to suggest that far more work can be done in this area, as opposed to presenting
any kind of definitive or reproducible look at the reality of data.

As stated in the methodology *, the surveys allowed participants to self-identify
by role and then classify a series of scenarios † as to being data, information, knowledge,
or other. The self-identification of role will be communicated in summarized form in
each survey below. The summary will be generalized to preserve confidentiality. From
each survey, I will abstract the most interesting explanations given of categorization.

Included in each summary will also be a description of the general proportions of the
answers. Each participant not only has their own conception of data, but their own
rationale for identifying things as Data, Information, Knowledge, or Other. The analysis
will also briefly touch on the nature of each participant’s categorizations of the Other,
and how they may influence their construction of data.

Each introductory paragraph will contain a count, as noted, of X data, Y information, and Z knowledge. Although it is possible that interesting statistical observations

may be made from the relative proportions of classification, the main items of interest
in my research were the participants’ explanations of their decisions, rather than the
quantization of the decisions themselves. In addition, the number of surveys is not sufficiently high for any statistically useful generalizations. As ever, this research is just
laying the foundation for more intensive research, and I feel that this survey structure
could form the basis for an excellent long-term study of many people’s conceptions of
data and how they change over time.


8.4.1 Survey I
The participant is working in the database labs of a university. They classified most scenarios as information and knowledge, with the counts of the various classifications being:
3 Data, 11 Information, 10 Knowledge, and 2 Other. Participant was careful to classify
other scenarios as a “lack of data” and “ambiguous” that increases the reliability of prior
categorizations as it demonstrates that participant is not afraid of novel categorization.

Data is a symbol without meaning. Some quotes:
•

“This doesn’t necessarily contain information and can be simply random.”

•

“A design may or may not convey information.”

•

“[secret] Code, in this case, is data since it does not have information. However, if it
is decrypted, it becomes information.”
The participant presents a novel interpretation of data. One explanation of the

unusual sense of symbol without meaning is that the participant’s role is sharply different when compared to the other interviews. Furthermore, when considered in light
of databases, a purely technical understanding of data could support the symbol-without-meaning interpretation if the participant does not assign computers the ability to
manipulate meaning.


Information is classified as “anything with meaning”:
•

“Information, since data doesn’t necessarily have a meaning and knowledge is factual/practical information. A letter, therefore, can be knowledge, but is normally
just information.”

•

“’Locations of parts’ would [be] basic information. The data has meaning, however it
does not detail practical or factual steps of information.”

•

“The data is known to be a planning program, so it has meaning.”
The notation of meaning in information has links with the information-as-commu-

nication theme found in some interviews above, but suggests a purely semiotic boundary:
symbols-with-meaning versus symbols-without-meaning, without any kind of communicative subtext.

Knowledge is classified as practical information. Some quotes:
•

“This is something that contains factual/practical information; i.e., knowledge.”

•

“Toughie; the story pertains to steps detailing a story, therefore it has chronological
sequence (i.e. - steps, procedure), so it is knowledge.”

•

“Step-based, procedural information is knowledge.”
This position is an interesting one to take, inasmuch as knowledge is a subset of

information that relates to action or time. Knowledge is anything with practical meaning,
or in other words, anything that is actionable.

The participant belongs in the data-as-communications camp, assigning computers
the role of data processors while granting a privileged human-centric view of information and knowledge as symbols with meaning (and utility). Although the relationships
between data, information, and knowledge are unusual, they do not present any unexpected new conceptions of data.


8.4.2 Survey II
The participant works for a defense department as an information processor. They
present a strong bias towards classifying scenarios as data, with 11 as Data, 6 as Information, and 9 as Knowledge. They did not take advantage of the Other category. One
hypothesis is that as an information processor they have a very strictly operationalized
definition of information. Still, the lack of any categorization of Other suggests that Data
or Knowledge were used as catchalls.

Data is an unanalyzed sign, set of signs, or communication. Some quotes:
•

“No analysis or recommendations for action are involved, leaving this as simply data.”

•

“The code has not been sorted, so it is still data. The fact that the data is encrypted
offers some insight for analysis, so that may be used to create information from this
situation.”

•

“Lacking detail about what the letter contains, I would default to the lowest category
of analysis, and assume it to be data for the time being. I can be sure that it is data,
but cannot determine from the description given if it is information.”
While “data as a fundamental building block of information” is unambiguous, the

attached semiotic definition results in an uncertain hypothesis. The interesting phrase,
“Lowest category of analysis,” suggests a strict and articulated set of relationships among
data, information, and knowledge. The very strictness of the hierarchy, of course, means
that accessing it is quite difficult: much of the participant’s knowledge about data is tacit
and assumed, making it difficult to extract from their explanations of reasoning.

Information is analyzed data:
•

“The data of how the user interface worked is changed to information by the analysis
of the users, categorizing things into ‘good,’ ‘bad,’ ‘useful,’ etc. However, this does not
include recommendations for action, and so doesn’t quite go as far as knowledge.”

•

“Quotes are chosen to reflect a given point, and so are offered with inherent analysis,
by the questioner, the respondent, or both. ”

•

“Poetry, while perhaps not designed as traditional analysis, does offer insight, and
information-at least about the poet. The poet has analyzed words, scansion, rhythm,
etc., changing raw data (perhaps Dadaist poetry?) into traditional poetry.”
Analysis of data creates information. However, if we explore the meaning beyond

analyzed data, defining the term becomes quite tricky. It is easy to exclude knowledge
as actionable information, but the very specificity of the term “analyzed data” precludes
most understanding. In some ways, the meaning of information could be as broad as
information as statements about nouns in the world.

Knowledge is information applied to decision making. In many ways, this classification echoes the knowledge of Survey I. Some choice quotes:
•

“Bob has used information (prior experience with traffic noise) to make a decision
on how to behave, transforming his experience into knowledge-knowledge that he
uses to judge what sounds to ignore.”

•

“Charlotte has not only analyzed information on behavior (making it information),
but has taken that a step farther, into knowledge, based on its applicability.”

•

“Dave is providing not only analyzed data (information), but is doing so to empower
action (a change in answers for the next time Eve encounters the situation, on a test
or in her outside life), changing it to knowledge.”
As knowledge is applied information (similar to Survey I), knowledge must be ac-

tionable information. This relationship is a reasonable derivation of Ackoff’s hierarchy,
put to different ends. While Ackoff’s hierarchy generally has knowledge-as-model, another understanding of model could be “information with practical consequences.” This
view necessitates filtered information, as information contains elements both with and
without practical consequences. By assigning practicality to knowledge, one can relegate
the elements of pure-theory without application to information until they are filtered
and contextualized by use.


8.4.3 Survey III
The participant is a manager of a consumer electronics repair workshop. They gave a
normal sorting of responses, with 7 Data, 11 Information, 6 Knowledge and 2 Other. The
others were identified as structure:
•

“If it is a program only with no facts or data, perhaps this is just something that
transforms data into information.”

•

“I think the empty document is something that assists in organizing data into information, but in itself is just a structure.”
The wording on these strongly suggests a standard hierarchy. Furthermore, the

relationships allow transformation: data becomes information becomes knowledge.

The participant’s definition of data is slightly more problematic. Although data
can nominally be defined as a statement without structure, there is little evidence to
indicate what data is a statement of:
• “I’d say this is data, as the facts have no relevance on their own. I’m not entirely clear
on whether it is data or information, though.”
•

“This one is interesting, also. I’d see each individual mp3 file as information, but
the group of them together as data, as it feels like more of a random sample than a
structured grouping.”

•

“The randomness and lack of interpretation leads me to think this is data.”

•

“The quotes themselves are data until they are processed, at which time that would
become information.”
The first quote suggests data are facts, but does not indicate the participant’s

understanding of fact. The second quote belies the traditional hierarchy by placing a set
of data above information, though the trend of randomness or “lack of structure equals
data” is still present. Thus, in my analysis, I have to default to the description “statement”
without further elaboration due to the participant’s answers.


Information is analyzed data:
•

“Now having the structure to put the information into, I think it is now information.”

•

“Data with structure.”

•

“This is a statement with clear intent and purpose, so I’d say the demand is information that the mugger is conveying.”
In keeping with the traditional hierarchy, information is data with structure or data

post-analysis. The last quote also implies some hints to information-as-communication
as well, though that meaning is overwhelmed by the data-with-analysis usage.

Knowledge is understanding:
•

“I’d say this is knowledge, as she has taken the information and used it to form an
understanding of the situation.”

•

“Someone’s impressions of something would be the conclusions they’ve drawn from
the information, so I’d say knowledge.”

•

“That selection is a conclusion based on understanding of what he is doing.”
From these quotes, the participant suggests that analysis of information becomes

knowledge. Knowledge as understanding or conclusions does not suggest the use to
which that knowledge is put, however.

This survey presented difficulties due to the fuzziness of the participant’s explanations. While there is some evidence of a standard hierarchy, the relationships between
the terms are poorly articulated. Here the survey did not provide enough guidance to
extract from the participant their ideas on how data, information, and knowledge relate
to one another. At the very least, this survey presents evidence of how deeply Ackoff’s
theories have penetrated the “white knowledge” * of society.


*

White knowledge is the everyday knowledge that “everyone knows” but that doesn’t need sourcing or
attribution due to its sheer ubiquity and acceptance. I believe Sir Terry Pratchett extended the term
“White Noise” for white-knowledge, capturing the same sense of randomness and lack of coherence. [59]

8.4.4 Survey IV
Participant is a social entrepreneur. Their self-description of their role emphasized
management and planning skills with a correspondingly high information consumption.

Participant overwhelmingly classified things as information, with 5 Data, 13 Information,
5 Knowledge, and 3 Other. The use of Other suggests a willingness to differentiate, although it seems that from descriptions of what they wrote, some of the categorizations
are in error: a few times participant categorized something as information but explained
it as data. Participant differentiates emotion from the traditional hierarchy, as they
categorize both mugging and poetry as flows of emotion. There is insufficient evidence
to articulate how emotion relates to data. Despite these problems there seems to be some
evidence for the traditional hierarchy.

Data is an observation:
•

“Random noise can be data.”

•

“Data only-no context or filters to apply.”

•

“Encrypted information is structured data without a context for Alice to extract
relevant knowledge from.”
Data is filtered and structured by knowledge, thereby producing information. The

participant understands data as subjective observations, as indicated by the keyword
“filter.” These observations are filtered and contextualized into information, in keeping
with Tuomi’s cyclic hierarchy. This set of responses matches interviews III and IV quite
well, suggesting some commonality of background. Most importantly, it suggests that the
realities of data explored in those interviews were not flukes, as the SDFN also produced
these results. This minimum demonstration of reproducibility is heartening as it validates
both methodologies.

Information is comprised of filtered, structured, and relevant communications:

•

“Instructions are information, organized data that conveys....”

•

“A short story is data filtered through the author’s perspective.”

•

“An empty word document is information because it has structure and that information may be the presence of structure only.”
These quotes suggest that structure, while necessary, is a component of the analysis

performed upon data to create information.

Knowledge has explanatory force. It entails conclusions and explanations of the
world. The participant is clearly using knowledge in the traditional understanding-theworld context.

• “The key is knowledge that once learned creates a new set of filters for Alice to
perceive the data through.”
•

“Dave is passing on the knowledge of why one procedure is right or wrong.”

•

“Design is choice, choice involves knowledge.”
However, knowledge is sharable and a way of creating context. The context-cre-

ation component of knowledge in many ways suggests Tuomi’s cyclic hierarchy rather
than Ackoff’s hierarchy in the way that knowledge plus data create information: “the
key is knowledge that once learned creates a new set of filters for Alice to perceive the
data through.” Knowledge is also a way of generating choice.


8.4.5 Survey V
This survey, produced by a research scientist, was incomplete and very terse. The participant categorized six entities as Data, six as Information, one as Knowledge, and one
as Other. The instance of Other is “probably both data and information,” which tells us
little about whether the participant was willing to explore the non-data categories.


•

Data are observations of the world:
“At this stage the numbers and times are data. Study and interpretation of these will
lead to information or knowledge about the thing that is unknown.”

•

“The noise is a meaningless stream not constructed into anything more significant.”

•

“Just listening to a live music stream is receiving data. Gaining pleasure from the
story being told by the data stream is a construct inside one’s head and is producing
information or indeed knowledge of a larger portion of music, e.g. the symphony.”
There is no evidence for any required activity with respect to the observations.


The identification of noise as data suggests that there is no intentionality associated
with the data. Unlike some of the interviews, wherein data is the product of sensors
and experiments, noise as data suggests that data is inherent in the world, and that the
observer’s knowledge is what allows for filtering and contextualization into information.

•
•

Information is contextualized data:
“A collation of data within a context, not just random.”
“At one level the planning program might be considered to be knowledge in itself.

However, it is information at the level before the unknown thing is revealed.”
In this instance, the differentiation between data and information is context. The

participant applies the term information to the planning program without exploring the
term. They give no explanation for how information in the planning program is both
unknown and contextualized.

Knowledge is understanding:
•

“This requires an understanding of the machine as a whole, i.e. a map, so is beyond
data and information.”
The use of the term “beyond” suggests the traditional hierarchy, but tells us little

beyond the simple use of the term understanding. The single categorization of knowledge
and the paucity of responses in this survey make intuiting their conceptions of data
problematic.


8.4.6 Survey VI
The participant is a service desk employee for telecoms. They place an unusual emphasis
on the term information, with 5 Data, 16 Information, 3 Knowledge, and 2 Others. They
note that an experience is not knowledge, nor can art be classified as data, information,
or knowledge.

•

Data are structured records:
“The quizzes are on relational algebra, which is more data-driven than say a quiz
about philosophy.”

•

“Data because it is a record of data. A record of few parameters. Day + temperature
outside her apartment.”

•

“Lists of things are perfect data, to me.”
Data seems to be a subset of information: structured records containing statements

about the world. However, the classification of quizzes as data is strange, although
the participant may be responding more to the topic of quizzes than to the entities
themselves. Thus, information with structure is data. There are no suggestions as how
to utilize either with knowledge.

Information is a statement about the world:
•

“What did Alice receive? A letter. The fact that it was a letter is a piece of information.”

•

“The files are information.”

•

“Bob ignores the noise. This is a piece of information.”

•

“What did the mugger do? Demand his wallet and watch. I don’t see this as data, it is
not a few parameters like a temperature chart.”

•

“I would say this is information. Yes, a lot of knowledge is behind the information,
but such is the cases of a lot of information-there is knowledge behind it.”
In the last two quotes, the participant defines the boundaries of information using

the example of the temperature chart for data and “background knowledge” for knowl-

edge. In many ways, all the examples are simple facts without relationships and the facts
are statements about the world.

Unfortunately, the few answers the participant gave for knowledge do not provide
a useful definition:
•

“The parts are at different locations. Where they are is a piece of knowledge.”

•

“A lecture is knowledge-based. It is not merely a list of items. It is not a list of
information.”
While there is a suggestion that knowledge consists of factual or true statements

about the world, there is no way to reach that generalization from these responses. Furthermore, as the participant uses the term “fact” when describing information, knowledge has to be something beyond simple fact.


8.4.7 Survey VII
The participant self-identifies as a corporate strategy manager. They gave balanced
categorizations to data, information, and knowledge, with an extraordinary 9 Other
versus 5 Data, 6 Information, and 6 Knowledge. They used the Other category to delineate
art, wisdom, and lists. Of all of the surveys so far, I am the happiest with this one because
the high incidence of Other categories suggests strict definitions for the three categories
of interest.

Wisdom structures knowledge, creating behaviors:
•

“A learned behavior from a past experience.”
Some of the scenarios were not even data, one categorized as a list or sequential

phrases:
•

“Not even data because there is no metadata to give context to the list.”

•

“I found this a tough one. At first I thought information however because the context
in unknown it doesn’t fit with my view of what information is. I also don’t think this

is data because it is not observational and again lack context. The best thing I could
think of was sequential phrases. You know each phrase is in a specific order but you
do not know the intent.”
Data are observations without interpretation:
•

“I think it’s either information or data because the code is just a transformation of
the content to maintain security. Once transformed the content may be contextual
in which case it’s information or observations which suggests data.”

•

“It’s just a list with no interpretation attached.”
The first quote indicates observations are data; the second indicates a lack of

interpretation. Interpretation-as-context suggests a normal hierarchy.

The participant indicates an understanding of information as context:
•

“Without any descriptors as to the type of letter the word letter has an ambivalent
connotation about it. There is a contextual element to a letter that renders the
content more than data but not necessarily knowledge which to me suggests value
and worth retaining.”

•

“I think it’s either information or data because the code is just a transformation of
the content to maintain security. Once transformed the content may be contextual
in which case it’s information or observations which suggests data.”
The indication of context as information is slightly unusual because the usual

formulation is data with context. However, information as the contextualizing element
is presented well enough here to leave little ambiguity as to how they think.

Actionable responses are knowledge:
•

“Because the location is critical for the part to perform its role in the larger machine.

The location and the part are linked and relative to another part and location. If you
just had the concept of the machine and location, you would only have data.... If you
understood how each part worked you would have information.”

•

“The secret key provides an actionable response to accessing the coded content
therefore it is knowledge.”

The precision of the answers is fantastic, especially with the examples that the
participant gives. They clearly indicate that actionable responses are knowledge and
give examples of how the relationship between categories progresses to said action.


8.4.8 Survey VIII
The participant is a counter-terrorism analyst who reads many messages daily, exploring
trends for counter terror issues. They identify 6 Data, 10 Information, 6 Knowledge, and
4 Other. The participant used the Other category when unsure, rather than inventing
new categories. They believe that live music and other entertainment do not provide
data in themselves, and that entertainment is a minor and irrelevant category: “one
cannot have true knowledge about something when the results are deliberately trivial.”
They articulate Ackoff’s hierarchy, but seem to employ a cyclic hierarchy in practice.

Data are objective records of activity:
•

“Dave has provided himself a reminder, which is a type of data; or he has uploaded a
format with appropriate font, pitch, etc., that he needs to use (perhaps he works for
a bureaucracy that is very particular about these sorts of things). Because it is empty
it cannot be more than data.”

•

“Impressions of an interface are simply impressions; the aggregate will be information. It is not ”data“ because impressions are not data, data does not allow of emotive
responses. But the impressions are not knowledge or wisdom, they are merely impressions.”

•

“Receiving an email is merely a fact; the email could be anything from a joke to a
sales proposal to a social invitation to collaboration on a project. the fact of receiving
the materiel is unable to be evaluated without content and context.”
Data are factual records that cannot contain subjective elements such as impres-

sions or thoughts. Entertainment, as stated before, does not produce data, but the record
of someone consuming entertainment is data, because it is an objective fact about their
person. Furthermore, all facts must be about activity of some sort. The participant is not

interested in scientific facts per se, but in records of actions that can be contextualized
into information and analyzed into knowledge about the target.

•

Information is data with context and assessment:
“As stated before, the context provides so much about m.o., etc., that this is more
than mere data, but because there are critical parts missing or not understood, this
is only information.”

•

“This is raw data regarding what was watched and when. There is no assessment of
the data nor is there a greater purpose that is being described. There is no wisdom,
knowledge, or information from this, only data.”

•

“There is no historical context as to why this methodology was chosen, so this is not
‘wisdom,’ and because it is a set of instructions, this is more than data.”
The assessment of the data may be performed by knowledge, but is never explic-

itly stated as such. If knowledge contextualizes data, then participant is using a cyclic
hierarchy, wherein knowledge contextualizes data, which in turn produces information,
which can be analyzed to knowledge.

Knowledge allows someone to make predictions about the world:
•

“Prediction moves beyond data and information and – presuming the analysis is
correct – gets to real knowledge.”
From an intelligence standpoint, this makes sense: predictions about the world are

one of the ultimate intelligence products. Thus, the outcome of knowledge is a prediction.

The nature of a prediction differs from the usual knowledge models of data-as-facts
constructions. Although the participant indeed considers knowledge to be models, the
nature of a prediction is such that it is an exported and actionable model upon which
other people can base their activity or lack of activity. Of interest here is the traditional
view that enemy actions can communicate volumes about their intelligence sources
and models of worlds, as unlikely actions may indicate the presence of a leak in one’s

organization. The ability to make predictions that are given to other people, therefore,
is tempered with far more severe complications than physical models of the world.


8.4.9 Survey IX
The participant is a housekeeper. In this job, they have a low exposure to workplaceenforced understandings of data. The participant has a very unusual categorization: 7
Data, 5 Information, 4 Knowledge, and 10 Other. The high rate of Other represents a
lack of broad categories. In a sense, this represents a lack of formalization from learned
patterns.

The participant makes a brief mention of data as technical-communication. In
other words, they consider data-as-bits a separate use of the term data:
•

“Computer data-a different use of the same word.... Information, in this case, music,
stored on computer hardware.”
In this, they also conflate the term with information, which is a common usage.


However, this separate meaning should not be confused with a conception of data as
data-as-communications. While using data as a term for computer records is certainly
possible among all of the three realities of data, those who use it as their primary construction elaborate upon it more; the idea of it being a side definition never really occurs
in practice, there usually is a seamless transition in usage depending on context. However,
this area is another in which far more research will be needed before it is possible to
make any definitive statements, especially the exploration of the use of the two terms,
data and information, to mean the same thing.

•

Data is a factual scientific observation:
“My father used to talk to me about the difference between facts and opinions. Short
quotes have the potential to contain either, but will more likely be composed entirely
of opinions than of facts. Why would anyone collect quotes from students reciting

facts? Chances are, the information would already be known, and be of little interest
to anyone watching the campus TV station.”
•

“This is data of a specific kind collected over a week by observation-albeit by the
subject of the observation himself.”

•

“The answers given on the quizzes are collected data about the knowledge and correctness of the people who did them.”
These factual observations are required to have a strong correlation with reality.


With the prior term of “computer data” specifically excepted in their comments, they
consider data to be inherently factual and representative of the world.

Information is a statement carrying meaning about the world:
•

“A completely empty document contains no information-it is an absence of information except for the fact that the document itself exists. Now, this may in some
circumstances be useful information, but the document itself is devoid of meaning,
since it’s completely empty.”

•

“Poetry is an expression of emotion rather than knowledge, confirmed information
or collected data most of the time. While one’s emotional response to winter wind
may be important, and interesting information, poetry about it is in a different class
than other forms of information about wind. Its purpose is emotional rather than
informative.”
Information appears to be a fundamental component of data and knowledge, serv-

ing as a general communicative vehicle. It also has some elements of meta-data, as
the presence or absence of the document is termed “Information.” More research is
required to see how significantly different professions interact with data, information,
and knowledge.

Knowledge is formalized, reliable instructions for activity:
•

“Reasons behind an answer could be knowledge or information - it doesn’t really
seem certain enough for me to call knowledge.”

•

“Lectures about database design... or other academic lectures are to confer built-up
knowledge from one person to others. It’s also information.”

Knowledge is transferable, certain, and constructed. The phrase “built-up knowledge” suggests a subjective, constructivist view of knowledge. Knowledge is viewed as a
subset of information because something can be both knowledge and information at the
same time.


8.4.10 Survey X
The participant is a senior software architect and acts as a programmer and database
modeler. They classified 12 Data, 10 Information, 4 Knowledge, and no Other. They make
a strong differentiation between data and information, but isolate out knowledge as a
privileged case.

Data are electronically stored observations:
•

“A letter is akin to an email which is electronic data. A letter in this case ins handwritten or typewritten data.”

•

“This would be digital data. Data that is store on a given medium, in this case, a flash
drive.”

•

“Live music is data. It is sound waves traveling from the instruments to the user’s
ear.”

•

“This contains specific data points, meaning the temperature outside.”
While there are strong elements of data as bits, there are also elements of data

as observations, which suggests that the participant uses both ideas simultaneously
inasmuch as data are stored observations. It seems that collecting data is a databasecentric act, i.e., data is something which is stored in a database. There are no semiotic
overtones or indications of stored meaning.

Information is a semiotically significant transfer:
•

“A short story is information. Generally, I would think of this as a fun trivial kind of
information that is meant to be temporary and enjoyed at that given moment.”

•

“This is information, signaling the mugger’s intent.”

•

“A program is a set of code that will run on a computer. It provides information.”
There is a component of intentionality to the transfer, but it is any kind of commu-

nicatively significant act.

The participant identifies knowledge as reasons behind interaction with the world:
•

“The instructions are knowledge. They are specific pieces of knowledge that Bob is
giving to Alice.”

•

“This is a knowledge transfer from the professor to the students.”

•

“This is an educated decision on what to pick and why.”
Knowledge as the basis behind the ability to make decisions can then be extended

as the ability to make predictions. Knowledge as decision-making is exploring possible
future outcomes and making choices that enable a desired visualized outcome, based on
the constraints of the search.


8.4.11 Survey XI
The participant self-described as someone who makes an action plan for a business
problem. They identify 10 Data, 9 Information, 5 Knowledge, and 2 Other. Others are
categorized as “don’t know.” The participant makes a strong differentiation between
information and knowledge.

Data are objective, precise facts:
•

“Definitely data. This time chart can be analyzed and information derived from it. A
time chart requires no interpretation.”

•

“Definitely data. A list. An objective measure such as temperature. You can use it to
make information.”

•

“Not sure why but I feel this is data. Guess it being files with objective stuff in it
(like a digital 1/0 recording) it is data. But I could be convinced in some part it was
information depending on the content of the files.”

•

“Again, not sure but I feel this is data. Hard to put this question in a work context
and ”live music“ is sort of an emotive term. Music requires no interpretation (maybe
lyrics do....) and is objective (i.e.. you can follow music notes on a sheet).”
Data are objective and listable components of information. All data are factual and

obvious to all observers without need for interpretation.

Information is the communication of unambiguous elements such as procedures:
•

“Imagining a situation where I receive instructions on how to take a sample for the
task force. Being a procedure, I will call it information. It will be detailed but designed
for me to follow, not to interpret. When it doesn’t need interpretation, then it is
information.”
Although the participant differentiates between information and knowledge, there

is the strong suggestion that they are similar. The participant articulates an objectivity-subjectivity spectrum: data being the most objective to knowledge being the most
internalized and subjective.

Knowledge is a framework of learning designed to situate problems:
•

“Imagining a scenario where I receive a short technical report to read on the task
force. ... This is knowledge. Detailed, contextual and requires interpretation. I
can learn something from a report and use it in my own framework to view similar
problems.”
The act of interpretation indicates that something is knowledge, whereas infor-

mation is far less subject to interpretation, though there are some suggestions that
information is used to build context.


8.4.12 Survey XII
The participant is a research engineer who assists with troubleshooting and does basic
research. They provided a standard distribution with 7 Data, 13 Information, 3 Knowledge,

and 3 Other, with the Others noting categories of music and filtering. Unusually, the
participant noted that experimental design was a process.

•

Data are specific observations of phenomena as well as stored bits on a computer:
“Specific observations of events - data. No abstraction or generalization.”

•

“Data - the individual bits that refer to the specific makeup of the songs are data - Its
file structure and formatting is information based on the mp3 standard - which is
information.”

•

“The computer sees it as stored data - it is also David’s preparation so far saved as
one Datum.”
There is no need to filter scientific data because they cannot occur without inten-

tional observation and measurements. The duality of data as observations and data is
very hard to reconcile. While it seems that data-as-bits is a side definition, there is no
evidence to blithely dismiss it. Participant also does not indicate that data are objective,
merely that they are specific, intentional observations. This answer illustrates one of
the difficulties of the survey: the inability to follow up on interesting leads that are
ambiguous.

Information is a set of analyzed data that can create predictions:
•

“Information made up of pieces of data” and that it is in some way a description of the
world: “The demand is information passed to Bob describing the state of the muggers
mind and his potential, this info is based on the muggers generalized knowledge that
Bob probably has a wallet - the specific demand is too abstract to be data, but too
specific to be knowledge. ”

•

“Contains some data i.e. measured temperatures etc., but usually has information as
well - i.e. predictions”

•

“Can’t be knowledge because it is not general or transferable, assuming it is primarily
fiction-will not contain data. You could possibly stretch the definition a little and say
it contains data about a fictional world. But the story does give some information
about the fictional content and contained in that Bob’s underlying assumptions and
experience, etc.”

Information exists between the abstract generalizations of knowledge and the
factual observations of data. This set-based conception resonates with some of the
ideas of data sets from the interviews and falls into the same philosophical framework:
collections of facts can be analyzed for patterns.

Knowledge produces highly generalizable concepts about the world:
•

“Knowledge because it involves abstract, generalized concepts that presumably have
been produced based on previous experience and analysis (data and info).”
Knowledge is predicated on both information and data, creating a gradient of

specificity. However, as the other descriptions of knowledge were poorly explained, it
is difficult to fully generalize knowledge’s relationships with data. However, working
from the data-as-facts construction, knowledge must be patterns that provide correct
predictions of the world.


8.4.13 Survey XIII
The participant is a researcher modeling industrial processes from an engineering perspective. They classified 4 Data, 13 Information, 4 Knowledge and 5 Others. Unfortunately,
the majority of Other responses were not well discussed, but they indicated a special
kind of data, a process, and curiously a null set:
•

“Null set. If file contains the correct number of pages and formatted, then ‘data’ ”.

The participant indicates that meta-data is a form of data, and technical data is a

special case.

•

Data are numbers without context:
“Only says what he has watched. Does not specify contents of programs. More
information however than just a series of time durations (data).”

•

“Time series (no attached informations, e.g., weather conditions, etc.).”

•

Sound is “special data.”
All of these data are numerical and contextless. Sound is intrinsically numeric and

thus is considered by the participant to be data. They show no evidence, however, for data
being anything other than numbers. The use of music/sound rules out measurements as
data and there are no suggestions for objectivity.

Information may be contextualized data:
•

“I would consider instructions to be more than ’blind measurements’ but less than a
discussion on how the machine works.”
Information, as catchall, has a non-standard relationship with knowledge and data.


Although there are hints to a hierarchy, there is no discussion of what actually comprises
information. From inference, information is contextualized data.

Knowledge is explanation, chief of a hierarchy of primacy:
•

“Depends on quotes: ‘Day is Hot,’ then information. Explanation to the meaning of
life: knowledge.”

•

“As it stands, then information, if giving reason for her to take her stuff back then
knowledge.”
Knowledge provides reason and explanation. Only new knowledge is classified as

knowledge, and information seems to be used as a catchall.


8.4.14 Survey XIV
The participant is a developer of an in-house optimization application. The most interesting aspect is the very low categorization of data: 3 Data, 14 Information, 9 Knowledge,
and 0 Other suggest a very interesting conception of data.

Data are facts without context or intrinsic meaning:
•

“A letter usually contains a commentary alongside any facts, giving the reader the
possibility to interpret those facts.”

•

“If the subject is unknown, the content are data. However, the scenario may be useful
to somebody in determining what the data concern.”
The contextless aspect is predicted by the information phrasing, but from the

second quote, Data is meaningless without said context. Data, without the ability to
interpret them or without a use, cannot transmit meaning. The participant may have
a constructivist view of knowledge, which suggests that only data contextualized as
information have utility. Data as proto-information, therefore, lack utility.

•

Information is data with context:
“There is a sufficient context to determine that it is a ’planning’ program (whatever
that is)”

•

“There is a clear context surrounding the basic demand.”

•

“The music itself is just data (unless it contains textual messages, which could be
considered information).”
Context provides meaning to data that support judgments. The process of contex-

tualization is what allows data to become information.

Knowledge is a judgment:
•

“Bob has had to make a judgment on whether this noise is of any interest.”
In some ways, the term “judgment” is disjointed from the other philosophies of

knowledge inasmuch as it combines imagining and predicting the future with then assessing the best outcome. Despite the novel term, however, the understanding is fairly
consistent.


8.4.15 Survey XV
The participant identifies as a SIGINT [signals intelligence] analyst and a subject-matter
expert in that field. They identify 6 Data, 1 Information, 6 Knowledge and 2 Other. The
others identified are: having an experience and art.


Participant draws a strong distinction between practical matters and art:
•

“To me, art is something different than data, information or knowledge. Art can’t be
easily classified as data or information, for instance. ”

•

“The music is live, and not electronically stored as information. As such, the music
is ’other’ in this case. It isn’t data, it isn’t information, and it surely isn’t knowledge
either.”

•

Data is a small, measurable, description of the world:
“The word ‘quizzes’ does not reveal anything particularly novel about Dave or his situation. Dave grades work from a relational algebra course, which is good knowledge
about Dave and his roles and personal knowledge. Working within an educational
facility also implies something about Dave. But a quiz is not a revelatory piece of
information. It would be more revealing if Dave were grading Theses or Dissertations
or reviewing Essays or White Papers.”

•

“This is data because it does not reveal anything about Dave or his network or his
intentions. A Word document that contains no information does nothing to further
analysis into Dave and his network. By the statement above, we already know that
he is working on a conference paper.”

•

“The weather report is data about current weather conditions, since it is a measurable
description of the weather.”
Data are the traditional building blocks of information, though the quotes above

suggest that data stems from non-novel revelations. Data are measurable, small, recorded
descriptions of the world or target.

•

Information is an imprecise statement about the world:
“This is more than mere data, because we know something about the sender and
recipient of the letter. It is less than knowledge, because we do not yet know more
about the sender or recipient, beyond their implicit connection to one another.”

•

“We know now that Alice is interested in building a device to cook her breakfast,
but we do not explicitly know anything about the device itself. This means that we
do not know how feasible her breakfast-cooking endeavors are. Because of this, the
sentence is merely information and not yet knowledge.”

•

“We know that someone is planning something, but we do not know explicitly what
they are planning. The details of the planned activity would make this into knowledge.”

The term “more than” suggests a traditional hierarchy. However, unlike most
hierarchies, information is used to identify statements that do not reveal useful patterns
due to their level of detail or other imprecision.

Knowledge is relationships or patterns:
•

“This is knowledge about the two targets within our tracked network, because it
defines loosely the roles that the two targets share between each other. Bob is a
keeper of how-to information, and he passes it to Alice. Alice may be a leader who
in turn passes this information to the rest of the network. She may be a workerlevel associate who executes construction of the machine based on Bob’s information.

She may be a connector who acts as a conduit to spread information on machine
construction throughout the network.”

•

“This is knowledge because it implies a relationship between the two targets – the
sender and receiver. A short story may imply a personal relationship between the
two targets, or it may reveal that they fulfill roles in publishing or media.”

•

“If we are seeking to understand Bob’s character, we now know that he enjoys symphony music. Beyond this, we can infer little from the sentence above.”

•

“A statistical profile may help reveal patterns of behavior in a target. This would make
it knowledge about the target’s behavior. There are a lot of unanswered questions
here though: how big is her sample? How many different activity types by the
target are included in the sampling? How many external environmental variables
(associates, external events, etc.) have been considered in the analysis? Finally, the
danger of statistical profiling is the Black Swan. Ultimately, this is knowledge that
leads to error.”
Knowledge is a pattern or relationship among entities. It allows for understanding

and prediction through application of patterns to future events.

The most important aspect of this survey is that it is completely analyzable according to the very simple analysis methods that this section employs and that it produces no
products that would have it be viewed as an outlier. If I were not the one doing the analysis, it would be difficult to write a rubric that would capture the different understanding
of instructions sufficiently for the coders to catch it accurately. Future iterations of this
research must have more questions and better instructions that can detect this level of
wrong model-of-survey in potential participants.


8.5 Survey Analysis
The results from the surveys successfully triangulate my results. While limited by the
same potential bias as the interview analysis, the high variation in conceptions of data
from the survey suggests that I may very well be on to something. On the other hand, the
phrasing of the survey instructions suggests that I may have indicated to my participants
what I was looking for, thereby eliminating scientific rigor from my experiment. For this
reason, the survey results are presented as a curiosity, rather than as proof of different
conceptions of data in the wider world.

Different roles have different uses for data, and there are differences of opinion as
to the methods of knowing, intrinsic nature, and purpose of data. In the surveys, people
referred to records, observations, and numbers, roughly mapping to the terms found in
the interviews.

Records, as technologically stored signs, can be data if they are stored properly.

Another term for record is row or tuple. These tuples can be about any topic and can
suffer from anomalies: authoritative conflicts in which the database may not represent
the thing in the universe of discourse. Despite this, to some people, any records in the
database are still data.

Observations are the act of applying consciousness to a reality. They can be subjective and inconsistent. At the same time, researchers used the term to indicate experimental observations that are objective and provide their own context. The term observation
in the surveys suffers from the same traps that it does in the interviews and is worth far
more research.

Numbers as data are used by both the database designers and the objective researchers. Numbers are either a more objective refinement of an observation or merely a

semiotic rendering that requires context and analysis to render into meaning. Numbers
are the sine qua non * of measurement, as they are the result and the goal of factual inquiry.

Those who believe data are facts can use the idea of numbers to represent this.

However, numbers are also the without which not of databases, being a different
order of thinking about a record. A number in a database sense can be either the content
of a record or the sign by which a record is stored, because a series of bits are simply
numbers. Both uses are evident and present evidence of a fascinating linguistic trap for
future research.

From the point of view of question of interest 1, the surveys were a complete
success: people demonstrated that they had realities of data that departed in ways
far beyond mere semantic differences over subjectivity and objectivity. Furthermore,
different roles tended to cluster around different understandings of the term, suggesting
that educational background combined with the current uses of the term strongly inform
meaning. However, from a methodological perspective, the tainting of the surveys with
the item of interest leads to results that are strongly suspect. While these results are
encouraging, no real conclusions may be drawn from them.

Without which not.


9 Different Realities of Data and the Database
How can different realities of data can be applied to the philosophical conceptions of the
database as corporate memory? Different realities of data provide a novel and interesting
context in which to think about corporate databases and database design. To a database,
data is an instantiation of a sign. Just as words represent both signs and reality, tuples *
in a database represent signs and the reality behind those signs. When we define data
as an instantiated sign, the nature of data in a database becomes very important. Using
the communicative definition of data, a database contains a number of signs and the
explicitly encoded relationships between the tuples.

In relational databases, there exist two categories of relationships between tuples.

The first, and simplest, is a grouping of tuples into tables. A table exists as a set of
identically formatted tuples representing different data of similar type. The second type
of relationship between tuples is relationships between tables: while tables group tuples
together, tuples can relate to each other based on internal codes or information.

The combination of these relationships allows for the computer to encode signs as
data in the form of tuples and to relate signs to each other, allowing for manipulation of
the signs to create new signs, and for information processing to occur outside the brain.

In database design, the term “business rule” † defines a statement that shapes the nature
of the database or the way the database manipulates information.

From a semiotic perspective, we can interpret these business rules as mental maps:
they exist to shape, form, and interpret the data through our understanding of the local
*
†

A tuple is a more formal name for “row” in a database, or a set of data of different domains stored together.

A business rule is a constraint or action imposed upon the database by the business reality within which
the database is functioning.


reality of business practices and norms. Through business rules interpreting data, the
computer can act on the data, pass new data to other business rules, or change the
business rules themselves: the exact same relationship that a mental map has with signs
in a conscious system, albeit on a much more simplified level.

The act of designing a database is strongly informed by the designer’s constructions
of data. The mapping of relationships and the nature of each table is a reflection on both
how the designer understands data and how the designer understands how the ultimate
users understand their data.


9.1 Case Study
Consider a case of a fictitious winery trying to create a data warehouse. I will use this as
a case study in which the ramifications of realities of data are illustrated in this chapter.

This case study was developed for a data warehousing course at my old university and is
of sufficient complexity to illustrate some of the issues raised in this chapter.

TigerWine Distributors was founded in 1985 by two college friends, Miss
G. and Mr. R. The company was originally based on a small family winery,
founded in 1878 and passed down through Miss G’s family, and has since
grown into a very successful wine distribution company. Today, the
original winery is only a small portion of their business. The California
based company now trades as an importer and distributor of wines
throughout the United States. Over the years, TigerWine Distributors
has built up an extensive portfolio of premium products and represents
a large number of national and international wine wholesalers as well
as many small vintners.

One of the greatest strengths of TigerWine Distributors is that it has
contacts with the complete spectrum of the wine-sales trade from small,
but prestigious, restaurants to the largest liquor stores and supermarkets. Their customers also include private individuals, regional vintners, traditional wholesalers, individual cash-and-carries, specialty
stores, and other independent outlets.


This setup is an excellent foil, as the hereditary views of Miss G’s understanding of
data as tempered by her university experience could quite plausibly differ from Mr. R’s

understanding, especially if Miss G studied a more scientific viticulture major versus’s
R’s business degree. If these managers commission an analytic data warehouse for their
distribution business, it is reasonable to suppose that they will understand data in different ways. To these two individuals, we will add a third, a Mrs. B, who is their CTO and
the person developing their data warehouse.

For purposes of this case study, Miss G considers data to be reflections of objective
reality, most comfortable manipulating data as observations from chemical studies of
grape biology. While she admits that there is business data to be collected and analyzed,
the data exist only in sales records: the movement of real things and the income derived
from their movement.

Mr. R considers the most important “data” in their records to be the intangibles of
customer satisfaction and error rates. He has heard that the data warehouse could explore
these questions but is not entirely sure what black magic needs to be applied to the “big
data” for that exploration to occur. In many ways, Mr. R considers data to be encoded
human communications and is interested in how to decode those communications.

Mrs. B is the CTO, and therefore considers all data to be subjective recorded impressions. While she considers this in her role, she also needs to design the database so
it can fulfill the requirements of the other two founders of the company. For purposes of
this case study, Mrs. B will be making a data warehouse that only covers the distribution
side of the company, and will be trying to understand the realities of data held by the
founders.

Designers can encode business rules in a database in two ways. First, designers can
build them into the design of the system, informing the grouping of columns, the design
of tables, and the relationship of one table to another. Relationships are a way of encoding
the constraints of reality into a constructed simulacrum, a database. A constraint is a

database’s way of enforcing a rule. A relationship between tuples is defined as: “this
tuple may not exist without a reference to another extant tuple.” This both encodes
the specific tuple the entity being created relates to, and enforces articulation of that
relationship.

In the context of TigerWine Distribution, the table business rules look like:
CASE
A collection of items offered for sale; this is the fundamental unit of sale
for the distribution side of the business. It can be: - a case of wine that
is not on a special promotion (case-wine) - a case of wine that is on a
special promotion (promotion-case) - a special promotion package that
consists of one or more bottles of wine and one or more other items.

(promotion-case)

This is a straightforward and unambiguous presentation of what the table contains
that would be accepted by any of the realities of data. The practice of the different
realities does not rely on the different formulation of specific business rules, but the very
choice of specification of the rules.

Therefore, for purposes of the case study, the question is to illustrate a table or
relationship that each of the three understandings would find particularly compelling or
distasteful. For data as objective measurements, Miss G would find the presence of a table
of written employee evaluations without any real “data” to back it up most objectionable.

It would illustrate the worst of subjectivity, without even offering the benefits that
computerized semantic analysis of a mass of product reviews. The tables she would most
approve of would be the automated sensor readings from the distribution warehouses
of the stock that was on each shelf. Miss G would also object to normalization because
it splits one “observation” across multiple tables; as the meta-data for the observation
belongs in a different table than the data.

Mr. R as someone who holds data as subjective observations, is nominally "okay"
with “anything” in the database, so long as it accurately reflects reality. Mr. R is not

interested in the merits or lack thereof of normalization, so long as the database accurately reflects the subjective impressions of reality that he wants it to encode. In a way,
this means that Mr. R treats all entities within the database as “equal data” with no
one tuple privileged against any other due to its intrinsic truth or relationship to the
universe. Mr R especially dislikes tables that are not internally consistent within the
rules of the database: just because reality gives people multiple phone numbers does
not mean that there should be multiple phone number fields in the “person” table, even
after the fact. For Mr R, if reality changes, the database should be reengineered to reflect
that reality accurately without consideration for the costs or impacts on established
software. Without a consistent and useful database structure, the queries to manipulate
and transform the presentation of data in the database will fail.

Mrs. B considers data to be encoded human communications or encoded information. Therefore, the database tables are a repository of human interactions with the
world, curated and made searchable by other humans. Any design that interferes with
that curation is discouraged, as it makes the task of the maintainer that much more
difficult. Because the tables in a database have on ontological value to Mrs B, she is comfortable with whatever arrangement of tables that will work best with the programs that
support human communication. Any table arrangement that exists for the data’s sake
rather than to support the programs that support human communication is pointless
and wasteful effort. For example, normalized relations that introduce inefficiencies for
the purpose of avoiding rare or even purely theoretical data anomalies is to be fiercely
resisted: it is inefficient and does not serve human communication. Instead, it gets in the
way of programmers and therefore makes the encoded data less likely to be presented to
the users.


The other, more significant way, is with queries *: exposing and relating signs in a
predetermined format. The real power of queries, however, is that the data they output
can be used as the inputs for subsequent queries: just like a sign or group of signs, one
mental model can output data to another mental model for further interpretation. A
query draws upon the encoded business rules in the database and applies some criteria
to find only interesting entries of interest. These entries can be composed from multiple tables, even positing characteristics not originally planned for in the database but
derivable from available evidence.

The importance of this similarity cannot be understated. When I discuss databases,
I am talking about the seat of external memory and cognition for distributed cognition.

Whereas other entities shape and perform I/O on the database, as well as on their own
interpretation, most of the processing in a database happens through the use of business
rules, either as constraints on database design or the implicit contextualization of data
via queries.

Queries with regards to different realities of data, are simply structures to produce
the desiderata as a function of expectations of the querent. The actual structure of the
query to produce the same information varies little based on the coder’s conception of
data, as there are “right” and “wrong” ways to access information in a database dictated
solely by the efficiency of a particular query.

While there are techno-philosophical approaches on more sophisticated queries
with their representation within the database and the methods used to construct them:
mainly varying the complexity of individual queries and whether or not they the output
is collated within the “host” programming language. These choices of programming and

*

A query is a way of retrieving sets of tuples from the database.


efficiency are subtly influenced by the realities of data of the programmer.

Specifically, the choice of whether or not to perform the desired operations within
a purely database context or to perform intermediate stages within a programming
language can certainly reflect the programmer’s conceptions of the “atomicity” * of
data. A programmer who views data as non-atomic will be more “comfortable” making
giant queries as the idea of splitting apart tuples and recombining them in an extended
chain does not produce a cognitive dissonance in the programmer’s mind. However,
for realities of data that are less about semiotic manipulation and who consider a tuple
an observed or recorded fact, intermediate translation stages within the context of a
more comfortable functional programming language would necessarily appeal more:
there is no violation of objectivity in operating upon retrieved data as contrasted with
reformulating the presentation of that retrieved data within the data retrieval system
itself.

Assuming that all three founders are sufficiently comfortable with programming
languages and database systems to write queries, we can approach this from their perspective. Miss G, with her reality of data as objective representation, would prefer to
retrieve numerical data gathered by automated systems and sensors. She would consider
much of the ancillary data in the system to be “metadata” supporting the certainty of
various conclusions that could possibly be made by manipulating the “true” data within
the system.

While she recognizes the existence of text in the database, the presence of the text is
considered to be merely a way to inform a website, rather than “data” to be collected and
analyzed like the data she gets from sensors. Her queries would focus on data retrieval

*

Atomicity: whether a given piece of data can be divided into associated attributes

instead of manipulation, and the statistical summation and estimation necessary to
make conclusions from the collected data would be performed in a sufficiently powerful
mathematical system of her choice. “Tampering” with the data through sophisticated
SQL queries, especially ones that filter or remove data on anything more than simple
“boundary” filters (between this time period, from X sensors), would be tantamount to
heresy. Removing the atomicity of the tuples in many ways invalidates the objectivity of
their storage choices and recording methodologies because it is changing the context
after the “experiment” (in her eyes) started.

Mr. R, as a business type, is most interested in tracking consumer sentiment over
time. He also sees data as the most ephemeral, human, and subjective. Data are observations, to be sure, but the are human observations. SQL is powerful because it can produce
unusual and post de facto relationships through the mechanism of queries. Mr. R is the
most comfortable of the three producing “new” information through the transformative
properties of queries, and sees nothing wrong with encoding a long query that touches
many tables to produce a novel and interesting output. In a sense, Mr. R. would like to
be able to “persuade” the database to produce the results he wants.

Mr. R is most interested in manipulating and analyzing the text as input in customer
and performance reviews. Because nothing in the system is objectively true, the things
which are more rich in human meaning, e.g. words, are more useful than the things
which require significant statistical analysis to extract meaning from, such as numbers
produced via sensor observations. The presence and analysis of the text in the database
is an interesting challenge, rather than an irrelevancy.

Mrs B. is not particularly interested in the analysis of stored data. As all of this
is a stored semiotic representation of human information, the primary purpose of the
database is to efficiently retrieve wanted records for humans to manipulate without

any incorrect or wasted retrievals. As efficiency of communications is everything and
humans are necessary for transforming the data into information, Mrs. B is less interested
in automated analysis and complex queries than R or G. However, she recognizes that
these tasks are desirable from R and G’s standpoint and will try to design the database
accordingly, creating specialized “views” (permanent queries which can be treated as
tables) to suit both of their requirements. Her queries and manipulations of the database
will be designed around efficiency and speed of retrieval and access rather than the
semantic content of the data itself.


9.2 System Models and Mental Maps
The semiotic concept of the system model for databases [60 and 61] is the mental map
of the designer instantiated in business rules and relationships *. The mental mapping
is the functional product of the user’s internal representations of data. This map is
exploring the database designer’s environment, both in the explicit requirements of the
system given to him by the consumer and through formal and informal observations of
the old system. The designer’s understanding of requirements informs the design and
implementation of the intended system model.

A trivial example of a system model mismatch can be seen in the finite state machines of a typical Sydney mass-transit ride. The correct system model of a typical subway
service is that the user starts by purchasing a magnetically encoded ticket, pushes it
through the machine at the front, and at the destination. If there are no more uses left
on the ticket, the machine captures the ticket.

However, some users may have an “insert ticket in starting machine, then discard”
*

Relationships are specific business rules that delimit how different tuples can or cannot relate.


model in their heads, leading to problems when the inevitable ticket checks occur on a
train. This confusion may be compounded by those stations that are open to the train
platforms, because they are too small to justify the staff that ticket-taking stations would
require. Thus, the user’s actions with his or her ticket may not correspond to the expected
actions by the designers of the ticket system, and from this basis, mistakes occur.

From the perspectives of the three founders of TigerWine distributors, they have
been working together long enough for a shared pidgin to spring up around the database.

Just as in the interviews the term “raw data” was used, the three founders would evolve
similar jargon to map specific concepts within the database to their own internal realities
of data. However, at the creation of the database these pieces of jargon would not have
yet evolved.

One of the initial debates the three would have at the creation of the various
datamarts supporting the distribution business. As the framing document states:
TigerWine distribution business has now grown to the point that the
partners would like to begin anticipating business trends. They want
to be able to predict patterns in wine availability along with trends
in wine drinking so that they can dynamically adjust their business
to maximize sales. It would be helpful for them to have a data system (warehouse or data mart) that allows them to track changes in
the products available from different suppliers, changes in the availability of various categories of wine, and changes in the buying habits
of their customers. They would also like to analyze the efficiency of
their current business processes, especially their warehouse inventory
management.


Miss G would be most interested in the objective and discrete changes in product
availability. These are based on objective business measurements that do not require
interpretation. As such, the analysis of buying habits is something of an imponderable
that is a useful pipe-dream but not discoverable from the “database” they have. Data, to
her, is a purchase or a price.

Mr. R is certainly interested in changes in product availability, but inasmuch as that

reflects the intentions of the businesses that they are interacting with. The data warehouse
being developed is a way to get inside the minds of people the business interacts with,
and therefore Data is a discrete decision recorded by a computer. He would prefer more
effort be spent in capturing entered text, as that provides more and better clues as to
the decision making process than simple sales numbers.

Mrs. B is interested in the technical challenges of interpreting these disparate forms
of human communication. As the author of the “extract, transform, and load” process,
Mrs. B. will be responsible for the manipulation and transformation of the various
external data sources that the data warehouse will be connected to. For her own use, she
is most interested in data that is well documented, as that gives a better understanding of
what the human communication is about. This documentation then allows the programs
to provide better contextualization of the data for human consumption.


9.3 The Consequences of Error
The system model interprets reality into an abstract model of relationships and norms
or business rules. A good system model corresponds well to reality: relationships in the
map correlate with reality. The proof of a pudding is in the eating and the proof of a
system map is in the using. Systems generate system maps in their user through exposed
affordances. If the affordances designed into the user interface correspond with how
users think they should behave, the users have a good system map.

A system model that is poorly envisioned or implemented, either because of design errors or misunderstanding of the user’s realities of data, causes multiple types
of potential error [62]: data corruption, data deviation, and misinterpretation. As the
system map deviates from reality, the incidence of the three types of error named above
becomes ever more likely.


Data corruption stems from where a system model does not allow or require sufficient updates from systems that observe reality. As parts of the system correspond to
earlier realities, they increasingly fail to reflect the current reality. Errors breed. In a
system where an interaction produces the right result for the wrong reason, the user does
not become aware of their mistake. In fact, a mistake only occurs if there are observed
secondary effects that were not desired by the user. However, further interactions may
lead these second (and third) order mistakes to create their own changes to the system’s
state, turning what was an unnoticeable mistake into something that can bring the entire
system to a screeching collapse. An example of such a problem is seen in preventative
car maintenance. If a car is improperly maintained, nothing will happen initially. As
systems fall out of timing, lose their lubrication, and suffer other failure-of-maintenance
effects, these failures cause other systems to break down. These secondary systems may
light the “idiot lights” in the dashboard, but for a bad driver, it is not until a furious boil
of smoke escapes from the engine that they are confronted with their mistake. If those
incidental problems are fixed without due thought, the underlying causes will simply
cause other systems to fail until the car is written off as a total loss. This unfortunate
outcome is purely due to the user’s system model diverging from the car’s reality.

The second type of error is data deviation. Whereas data corruption stems from
data falling out of synchronization with reality, data deviation starts with the data being
out of synchronization due to a database design that cannot accurately reflect reality.

Incorrect assumptions, norms, or ignorance can lead to data deviation. I can draw a
trivial example from a special case of postal mail: “general delivery” that may instruct
mail to go to a centralized post office to be held for pickup. Corporate database systems
may not be designed to recognize general delivery, nor may they have business rules
suitable for letters addressed under general delivery notation. Geographic Information

Systems have even had problems mapping other post office special cases (Postal Boxes)
to geographic location for purposes of illness tracking [63]. These problems are data
deviations, in which reality does not conform to the database and errors occur when
there is an irreconcilable mismatch.

Misinterpretation, on the other hand, stems from problems in others’ interpretation of tuples in the database. As the interfaces access the database, the system models
of the interface designers may map the meanings of the relationships and the tables
in the database incorrectly. This leads to interfaces which present the context of data
incorrectly and thereby a cascading failure of meaning which eventually leads to mistake
and error.

Corruption stemming from different realities of data requires more research at this
time. My research did not provide sufficient evidence to make useful specific examples
of the secondary and tertiary effects described above.

The data warehouse envisioned by G, R, and B, may experience some deviation.

Data deviation would stem from a mis-implemented ETL stage by Mrs. B. In this deviation,
if the transformation misunderstands the reliability or meaning of the column being
translated, the new column could appear correct in its new context but have its meaning
shifted significantly. One probable cause of this error is misunderstood labels for financial
transactions, altering the “start and stop” time periods of some transaction aggregations.

Misinterpretation in Mrs B’s data warehouse would stem from Miss G and Mr. R misunderstanding the documentation of the tables. While this looks like data deviation, the
error of misunderstanding happens during data consumption rather than data recording
and is a function of in-company documentation and communication practices. Because
miscommunications occur when the designer fails to express her intentions correctly, it
is a discrete category with different failure modes than deviation.


9.4 Database as Corporate Mind
It may even be possible to extend the new understandings of the reality of data to an
exploration of the philosophy of the corporate mind, for a corporation’s memory is in
its databases. Donald Cunningham explains John Deely’s theory of human experience
when he states [64]:
Umwelt model and argues that our cognitive experience is mediated
through a labyrinth of signs, a personal world, created by the organism
via species-specific sensory characteristics and particular experiences
in the physical world. This umwelt comes to define those things that we
pay attention to and consider as “real.” Humans, uniquely, can create
signs that go beyond immediate experience: Words, pictures, bodily
movements and the like can become part of our umwelt even though
they may mark objects that have no literal basis in the physical world.


This theory of human cognitive experience can be extended to memories. Only
that information which is part of the corporate databases can be considered part of
a corporation’s umwelt. Although individual agents of a corporation may be aware of
reality not otherwise informed by the databases, the corporate entity can only perceive
reality through the inputs and outputs of its databases. This important link between the
database and reality requires that the database designer’s system model corresponds
well with reality to reduce errors in database design.

A tragic example of the problems of corporate memory occurs in the story of
the American MERS Corporation, a tiny corporation that maintains a database of most
mortgages held and transferred for securitization [65].

The implication is that MERS is superior to the local courthouse system. The evidence is the reverse. Chris Peterson has described the
utterly unorthodox corporate governance system of MERS, where employees of other firms put on a MERS hat for a short period as a “MERS
certifying officer” and execute documents. MERS does not supervise
these individuals. Indeed, it specifically disavows any responsibility
for the accuracy of MERS’s records: MERS makes no representations or
warranties regarding the accuracy or reliability of the information provided. MERS disclaims responsibility or liability for errors, omissions,
and the accuracy of any information provided. MERS does not input

any of the information found on the MERS(r) System, but rather the
MERS Members have that responsibility regarding mortgage loans in
which they hold an interest. ... And there are widespread indications
of member non-compliance with MERS processes, such as making assignments without having proper corporate authorization (including
out of bankrupt entities). Moreover, the updating of records by MERS
members is strictly voluntary.


Thus, banks are using MERS as their memory; they cause it to be a model that
reflects their reality. However, they have no obligation to keep the model accurate, and
have no recourse or backups when problem arise because MERS is so much more efficient
than the traditional paper audit trails. This conflict of priorities produces predictable
results: an error-filled foreclosure process with many parties fighting over the reality of
possession before courts and the U.S. congress.

To a corporation, errors in database design allow signs to be encoded into the
database that do not correspond to reality. Therefore, the corporation’s actions will
deviate from the most optimal, because the corporation is endeavoring to solve a problem
that only has a tangential relationship to reality. Poor system models beget worse system
models. It is inevitable that database design passes from the initial designer to subsequent
designers employed to make changes to the database.

With a poor system model, only the most glaring of errors advertise that they are
errors. Other errors simply alter the corporation’s responses to reality without causing
agents to realize that the responses do not perfectly correspond. In the latter case,
as secondary designers attempt to change the database to adapt to changing business
conditions, the initial system model residing within the designer’s imagination influences
all subsequent system models. Without careful consideration and reflection at each stage,
the errors induced by the database structure cause the database to diverge further and
further from reality.


In context of the example of TigerWine Distribution, they suffer from a glaring
error in their system model: wine is identified by the case, and only with difficulty as
individual bottles. Because they associate wine with cases of wine, the most obvious
error is that they won’t identify other opportunities to sell bottles or unusual containers
of wine. The “with difficulty” above indicates that their marketing department forced
through a change: promotions could contain bottles of wine as well as unusual items like
corkscrews or cheese. This presents a logical disconnect within the database itself: half
the company understands wine as something which comes in a case, and the other half
understands wine as something that appears inside a pre-packaged promotion. While
the humans involved are certainly smart enough to understand the em nature of a case
of wine, the fact that these ontological descriptors of containers are hardcoded into the
database informs the corporate identification of objects and its behavior towards them.

As the technology ages and new systems are built upon the old technology, it is quite
possible for these artificial divisions to be encoded in the new systems like unto laws of
nature. This subsequent generation is when the “schizophrenia” sets into the corporate
mind, as the databases state a thing that is simply not true in “reality” but fully accepted
as true within the corporate memory.

Fixing errors in a production system is difficult as “the cost of fixing errors grows
exponentially as a function of elapsed time to discovery.” [66] Since these errors exist in a
production system that has run for some time, the cost of fixing the errors is prohibitive
at the stage when the errors are found. The only way to insure that the system model of
the database designers keeps the system in line with reality is to inspect the database
and insure that it corresponds with reality within the required specifications.

By understanding the impact the various users’ realities of data has on a database
and on corporate memory, this philosophy of corporate mind combined with an under-

standing of how we conceive of data can provide tools for a data modeler to create better
databases. Normal database modeling methods are quite formalized, exploring the relationship of tuples to each other and whether or not to split them into new tables. Other
database design methods simply instantiate the tables of a “default” database and allow
the designer to connect new tables and data structures to the pre-extant core *. In many
ways, most database-creation methodologies already expect the designer to understand
the participants’ realities.

When teaching database design, I had students create data-flow diagrams mapping
the current reality. They then updated the DFD’s so that they could reflect some sort of
more coherent “future reality” and created the database design from that. The process
of updating designs from current reality to future reality was never explicitly spelled
out, merely left as a “well, you should solve this yourself” method for the students. An
understanding of the various realities of data, and especially of how different people
understand data, may provide for better database design.

An understanding of data will provide for better design neither by increasing
normalization † nor by providing better requirements-collection methods. Instead, the
discussion of realities of data will provide for better design by giving the practitioner
more tools to understand the clients’ requirements. Although this will not help with
those clients who insist on a turnkey design, the understanding of the different realities
will help render what the clients think is data into the database, including elements of
data that are not currently present in the artifacts ‡ inspected by the database designer.

10 Conclusion
This research aimed to understand how users perceive the nature of data. In a more
limited sense, I wanted to demonstrate that users have different conceptions of data and
a method for discovering hints as to how they use and understand data. In that light, I
have been successful. This research should serve as the foundation to more specific and
focused studies into the different social constructions of data present in our societies
and what epistemological and ontological basis data may have.

With the use of the term “raw data” there is some evidence for trading zones being
established as people with different usages of data must discuss it to function in the same
way. In a more limited sense, this evidence may just be an artifact of the narrowness
of the study. Either way, more indication into the establishment of trading zones with
different technological concepts is strongly indicated.


10.1 Results
People have different realities of data. My methods are capable of generally distinguishing between different realities. I have found three distinct realities: data as communications, data as subjective observations, and data as objective facts.

In the data-as-communications category, users generally consider data to be electronically encoded semiotic representations, or bits stored on a computer. Although
some people in this category believe that data are any communications (i.e., data are
signs), most believe that data are re-encoded and computerized signs. This construction
tends to share some space with the other understandings in the sense that people can
use the term “data” in an electronic sense when referring to “computer data” and in

the “proper” sense of facts or observations. However, even in that case, there is more a
blending of the two meanings rather than two distinct meanings.

There are people who classify data as observations. Observations, in this case, are
any acts in which a sensor (such as the brain and eye) takes note of the world. These
observations are then filtered according to some knowledge and situated with context as
information. All observations are data, but not all data is important. Only data situated
properly in the correct context can be assessed for utility.

Considering data-as-facts, people equate facts with objective, true, statements
about the world, and comprehend data as small facts about specific parts of the world.

Facts are a superset of data, information, or knowledge, being objective and truthful
statements about the world regardless of scope. People in this category tend to favor
strongly objectivist views of science and tend to be scientists and some types of engineers.

Data as facts does not require external context, and is packed with its own meta-data: its
precision, provenance, reliability, and reproducibility, among other things. Data as facts
strongly tend to be numbers.

It is clear from the, admittedly biased, results of the surveys that many other
variations exist on these three simple categories. These findings are in no way exhaustive,
merely suggestive of what I found in the majority of my interviews and surveys. It is
obvious to me that far more research is necessary before any definitive statements
can be made about the different realities of data present and, especially, their possible
interactions and failure modes with each other.

The Social Data Flow Network has great utility as an reality-discovery methodology.

The SDFN, inspired by the data flow diagram methodology of systems design, is quite
able to cause participants to differentiate between practical definitions and theoretical
definitions when discussing a participant’s construction of data. And is therefore better

than more focused requirements gathering methodologies at this task.

The SDFN produced many useful discussions of data, causing participants to reflect
on their own working definitions and on how they contrast with formal or intuitive
definitions. The propensity for generating self-reflection is a useful product of the
iterative categorization of the SDFN. This process of iterative categorization provides
mechanisms for inspecting peoples’ functioning definitions, rather than the theoretical
definitions under discussion.

The internal consistency of the results between the analysis of the transcript and
the analysis of the diagrams suggests that the generation of the SDFN diagrams provides
a useful triangulation method for both reflection during the interview and subsequent
analysis. However, the SDFN requires significant refinement: it must be made less intimidating; steps must be made to make analysis easier; it needs to be codified such that
other people can perform both the collection and analysis stages of the SDFN..


10.2 Methodological conclusions
The interviews via SDFN and surveys were successful. The SDFN diagrams were useful in
producing directed discussions which uncovered personal realities of data. My chosen
research group, the fine engineers, scientists, and researchers at the company I conducted
interviews at, were a fantastic initial target. The group presented a number of different
trading zones as scientists and engineers interacted in a highly competitive area. The
research was both practical and theoretical and had to show progress on both fronts,
creating many different goals and many different research languages.

The informal atmosphere also presented significant advantages. My interactions
with the team allowed for a sense of reassuring informality in the interviews while the
non-interview interactions (mainly sharing meals) allowed for a sense of rapport that

helped the difficult sections of the interviews slide past. This informality allowed people
to communicate their insights without worries that what they were going to say would
backfire.

The survey in practical matters was a partial success. Although the second survey
was generally able to probe the thoughts of the participants, a number of people thought
the survey had a different intent, and thus their answers presumed different questions
than those I asked. As such, the wording and the scenarios could be tightened. All things
considered, however, the survey’s results are acceptable for use, but could stand quite
a lot of work to improve their reproducibility and accuracy. Nonetheless, the survey
presented some useful insights as to how wildly different people understand the nature
of data.


10.3 Further Research
Further research will be pursuing two primary goals: methodological improvement
and philosophical exploration of the philosophy of data. This research is about applied
philosophy: using philosophy as an engineer would use science. This research is designed
to go some distance towards combating the “ivory tower” [67] perception of philosophy,
especially philosophies of technology *. The ultimate targets for this research are the
practitioners who use data every day: engineers, businesspeople, scientists, systems
designers. With this research, I hope to encourage philosophical thinking in those areas
and to demonstrate that many worthwhile philosophical activities must be rooted in a
firm knowledge of their respective areas.

*

Our philosophers of technology and science, in the main, are not practitioners. While their outsiderness
lends some objectivity to their philosophies, their lack of capability in the fields of which they speak
(especially high-tech) means that many actual practitioners in those fields feel no obligation to listen to
what these outsiders are saying.


If this research can inspire another IST practitioner to explore aspects of the philosophy of technology in which they have a personal investment, then this research
will have been useful. All the further research directions must be focused in integrating
philosophy with practice. Research that involves practitioners and enhances their capabilities for meta-reflection is good research. Research that isolates practitioners and
returns nothing is bad research.

This section cannot articulate all the possible research directions, for there are too
many unknown unknowns. While most of the known research directions are designed
around targeting or identifying flaws in the current philosophy or methodology, those
are only short-term goals. In the longer term, as the rate of change increases in the world,
our understanding of data will change with it, as data is the reified basis of software, in
one way or another.


10.4 Final reflection
There is science to do and research to be done in understanding different conceptions of
data. This dissertation merely paints the broadest outlines of possible questions to ask.

The idea of different constructions of data offers many ideas to many disciplines, and
borrows just as many. In the discussion of “what is data?”, there is no a consensus on an
answer, and investigating that definition and the trading zones constructed around it
will pose the majority of the work for the next few research projects.

One major research direction for the philosophy of data is to define a set of open
questions of the philosophy, questions that will guide researchers into more specific areas
of inquiry, just as Floridi’s open questions have guided the philosophy of information.

Creating a framework of research as a research project is something that will allow
cooperation and mutual work without much unnecessary duplication of effort.


The results must be accessible. It is far too easy to scream, “This was a triumph,”
when the actual conclusions are hidden behind a wall of polysyllabic vocabulary and
inscrutable jargon. The worst danger for this field is articulated by Eliezer Yudkowsky:
“Well, sounding wise wasn’t difficult. It was a lot easier than being intelligent, actually,
since you did not have to say anything surprising or come up with any new insights. You
just let your brain’s pattern-matching software complete the cliché, using whatever Deep
Wisdom you’d stored previously.” [68] If the research of the nature of data is reduced to
pattern-matching Deep Wisdom without any pragmatic export or falsification of results,
I will have failed.

People have different realities of data. They can think of data as stored signs of
communications, data as subjective observations of the world, or data as objective and
numeric facts. They can think about data in ways not articulated here, and I intend to
find out what those ways are.
