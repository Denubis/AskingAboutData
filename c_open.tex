I thank the employees of BlueScope Steel in Australia for participating in my survey and answering difficult questions about how they thought about the world. Their participation has made my research possible. 

I appreciate the members of the Pentagonâ€™s INTELST mailing list for their participation in the survey and Kevin DiVico for putting me into contact with them and his assistance in other matters. 

I extend a significant deal of gratitude to my present and past advisers, Dr. Anthony Corones and Dr. Deborah Bunker. Without their expert guidance and assistance, I would not have had a dissertation of this quality.

I sincerely thank John Rennie for his expert editing assistance, lending a final polish to this work.

Lucy: "Coffee on Sunday?"

Mikhail: I can intone only: "Ia! Ia! Cthulhu fhtagn! Ph'nglui mglw'nafh Cthulhu R'lyeh wgah-nagl fhtaga -"

To the rest of my friends: thank you for keeping me sane-ish during this three year ordeal. Without their time, friendship, and support, I would never have completed this work.
