That question is the fundamental investigation of this dissertation. I have developed a methodology from social-scientific processes to explore how different people understand the concept of data, rather than to rely on my own philosophical intuitions or thought experiments about the <delimited detail='quotation'>“nature”</delimited> of data. The evidence I have gathered as to different individuals’ constructions of data can be used to inform further inquiry of data and the design of information systems.                          <break/>  My research demonstrates that people have different constructions of data. The methodology of the Social Data Flow Network, created for this dissertation, has proven able to probe those understandings. The Social Data Flow Network, loosely based on a Data Flow Diagram and combined with ideas from Social Network Analysis, provides a way of discovering practical definitions of hard-to-operationalize terms like data. The process of repeatedly categorizing various items as data allows the methodology to explore how participants actually use the term, rather than relying on theoretical dictionary-based definitions.                          <break/>  Analysis of the interviews found three different constructions of data: data as communications, a container for meaning; data as subjective observations, sense-impressions filtered by knowledge; and data as objective facts, measurements revealing the relationships of reality<link><descriptionsymbol detail='footnote'><m:math><m:mrow><m:mo>*</m:mo></m:mrow></m:math></descriptionsymbol></link>.                          <description detail='footnote'>                           <descriptiontag><link><m:math><m:mrow><m:mo>*</m:mo></m:mrow></m:math></link></descriptiontag>                           <descriptioncontent>For a longer summary of this research, look at Appendix D.

The purpose of this research is to explore the different conceptions of data that may exist beyond the domain of <synonym detail='abbreviation' tag='IST'>IST</synonym> and demonstrate a methodology that allows practitioners to access the conceptions of data present in their workplace.                              <break/>  Exploring a conception of data is fundamentally a philosophical problem. A person’s conception of data stems from the affordances they attach to it, their belief in its underlying qualities, and their differentiation between data and non-data. However, this philosophical problem cannot be solved through intuition alone: a methodology is necessary to extract a person’s conception of data.                              <break/>  These individual conceptions can then be formalised as “philosophies of data.” By ‘philosophies’ we mean answers to the questions like, ‘What is data?’, ‘What is data for?, ‘How do I know the data is reliable?’, and ‘What are the properties of data?’ While individuals may not “have philosophies,” understanding that individuals engage philosophically with their conceptions of data allows the creation of a tool to probe those philosophical conceptions of data in a workplace. By probing conceptions, the <synonym detail='abbreviation' tag='IST'>IST</synonym> practitioner effectively uncovers de facto philosophies of data in individuals.                              <break/>  This research, however, does not propose to uncover fundamental philosophies of data, only some common conceptions of data that may exist in workplaces. These different conceptions of data can produce frustration, error, and miscommunication if people with different conceptions interact unknowingly. Conceptions of data include context, reliability, constraints as to its nature (can it be a description, must it be a  number), the means of collection, and the means of manipulation.                              <break/>  I have created a methodology called the Social Data Flow Network (<synonym detail='abbreviation' tag='SDFN'>SDFN</synonym>). This interview technique has elicited people’s conceptions of data<link><descriptionsymbol detail='footnote'><m:math><m:mrow><m:mo>*</m:mo></m:mrow></m:math></descriptionsymbol></link>, demonstrating three different conceptions within a particular industrial research workplace. A survey developed from the <synonym detail='abbreviation' tag='SDFN'>SDFN</synonym> technique hints that there may be different conceptions of data present in the intelligence analysis community and the <synonym detail='abbreviation' tag='IST'>IST</synonym> practitioner community.                              <break/>  It is my hope that <synonym detail='abbreviation' tag='IST'>IST</synonym> practitioners can use the <synonym detail='abbreviation' tag='SDFN'>SDFN</synonym> I have developed to make better interfaces and databases: through the understanding of a client’s expectations of data, the system can provide natural interaction methods that conform to the client’s expectations of what data is and is not. The SDFN might also be used within an organization to reduce miscommunication and error: the explicit definition of one particular conception of data for a workplace.                               <section detail='section' location='aut:16'>                               <sectionnumber>4.1</sectionnumber>                                 <sectiontitle>Methodological Summary</sectiontitle>                                 <sectioncontent> The primary result of this thesis is the methodology of the Social Data Flow Network. The SDFN uses repeated categorization to explore how individuals group informational or communicative flows into categories. By eliciting categorizes that focus on data, information, and knowledge, the participants use the categorization to operationalize their epistemological understanding of data: they indicate what is and is not data and how it becomes information and knowledge. This elicitation helps both the interviewer and the participant to discover their own situational conceptualization of data.                                  <break/>  The repeated categorization allows participants to generate and resolve cognitive dissonance situated around the differences between their theoretical definitions of data                                <break/> and their practical uses and categorizes of data. In interviews, participants demonstrated a refined understanding of their own conceptions of data at the end of the interview, catalyzed through their participation in the SDFN.                                  <break/>  The SDFN involves the articulation of roles as entities, descriptions of content flows between those entities and the categorization of those flows as data, information, knowledge, or other. Participants iterate over a task domain defined at the start of the interview, discussing all the entities and flows between those entities involved in the task. The interview concludes with an opportunity for the participant to self reflect on their <delimited detail='quotation'>“philosophy”</delimited> of data, discussing what they categorize data as and how it becomes information and/or knowledge.                                  <break/>  A scenario based survey, inspired by the SDFN was also trialled with less satisfactory results. While the survey did demonstrate that intelligence officers, IST professionals, and other industrial research employees did have different conceptions of data, it did not do so with any statistical rigor nor with the depth of discussion that the interviews provided.                                  <break/>  The <synonym detail='abbreviation' tag='SDFN'>SDFN</synonym> combines two concepts for a novel purpose.

A node is the component of a graph that is a point. The point can be labeled or unlabeled. The node is the element of the graph that is a representation of a thing. Sometimes the thing being represented is a computer or a person, or a place, but in any event the node represents a noun. Edges on the other hand are the relationships or connections between nodes. An edge represents a <delimited detail='quotation'>“flow”</delimited>  of action or stuff between nodes. Edges traditionally have served as network links, roads, phone lines, and simple representations of adjacency. A graph is a non-topological method of representing the relationships between entities through edges and nodes. Edges can be directed: they show a flow or relationship from one node to another. The direction on the edge indicates the direction of relationship. For example, consider Alice and Bob. To represent Alice sending a letter to Bob, we would make both of them nodes and draw a directed edge from Alice to Bob indicating the one way flow of the letter. By adding the concept of directionality to edges, a causal element is introduced to the representation-specifically, that the originating node causes a relationship to the recipient node. This addition of causality then precipitates the idea of connectiveness. A node may or may not be reachable by other nodes. A graph or subgraph where every node can be reached from every other node is called a strongly connected graph. A graph where that’s not true is weakly   connected. When we apply the idea of strongly connected graphs to social networks, we can identify small groups by identifying strongly connected subgraphs within a larger, weakly connected graph.  </descriptioncontent>                                 </description>  the idea of the social network with that of the data flow diagram. In social network analysis, it is possible to represent interactions between people, a social network, through graphs. Each node on a graph represents a person and each edge represents some sort of connection between people, as a function of the interactions of interest to the researcher [<link destination='1:Scott1988' location='1:Scott1988'>1</link>].                                  <break/>  The Data Flow Diagram [<link destination='1:Larsen' location='1:Larsen'>2</link> and <link destination='1:Sun2006' location='1:Sun2006'>3</link>] contributes its diagrams to the <synonym detail='abbreviation' tag='SDFN'>SDFN</synonym>. A <synonym detail='abbreviation' tag='DFD'>DFD</synonym> originally was designed for structured programming. The document produced by the <synonym detail='abbreviation' tag='DFD'>DFD</synonym>would combine the delineation of a universe of discourse via the context diagram with the highly precise definition of flows into and out of that diagram. A Universe of Discourse (<synonym detail='abbreviation' tag='UoD'>UoD</synonym>) [<link destination='1:Wiener1950' location='1:Wiener1950'>4</link>] is the term used for defining the topic under consideration. Everything within the <synonym detail='abbreviation' tag='UoD'>UoD</synonym> is relevant and must be modeled. Everything outside the <synonym detail='abbreviation' tag='UoD'>UoD</synonym> is irrelevant. Interestingly, as the <synonym detail='abbreviation' tag='DFD'>DFD</synonym> was repurposed for business modeling, the <synonym detail='abbreviation' tag='UoD'>UoD</synonym> remained the same: it is still asking, <delimited detail='quotation'>“What bit of reality do we care about right now?”</delimited>                               <break/> The <synonym detail='abbreviation' tag='DFD'>DFD</synonym> would then be refined through a process of <delimited detail='quotation'>“zooming in”</delimited> on that context diagram to expose the transformations required to produce the outputs from the inputs. Each additional level would seek to conserve inputs and outputs, and thereby produce a diagram that could be mapped to the functions and variables necessary for a structured program.                                  <break/>  The <synonym detail='abbreviation' tag='DFD'>DFD</synonym> contributes great ideas to the <synonym detail='abbreviation' tag='SDFN'>SDFN</synonym>. It contributes the idea that data is something that can be modeled. The conception of data embodied by the <synonym detail='abbreviation' tag='DFD'>DFD</synonym> is that the modeler can translate reality into data-as-bits and that data could be described through text. All actions in the data flow diagram are considered either flows or transformation. Data flows from sources through transformations, and out into sinks. The sources and  sinks are entities outside the scope of the diagram. By decomposing these transformations into ever simpler and more detailed sets of sub-transformations, modelers could design an entire software system intended to process and transform data. The modeler acts as translator: taking the described reality by the client and forcing it into a computerized mold. Repurposing the methodology of the <synonym detail='abbreviation' tag='DFD'>DFD</synonym> by subtracting the modeler’s translation suggests that it might be possible to use my method to probe and document a client’s subjective reality.                                  <break/>  The <synonym detail='abbreviation' tag='DFD'>DFD</synonym> also contributes an iterative structure for the definition of reality. The iterative techniques explore the <synonym detail='abbreviation' tag='UoD'>UoD</synonym> in order of increasing specificity from the vague context diagram describing the universe of discourse to highly detailed sub-sub-sub (etc.) transformations required deep in the diagram. By starting with broad generalizations, the <synonym detail='abbreviation' tag='DFD'>DFD</synonym> insured that the client was thinking about the whole task and did not immediately become fixated on any one aspect. With the <synonym detail='abbreviation' tag='DFD'>DFD</synonym> iterating across each declared <delimited detail='quotation'>“transformation”</delimited> and decomposing it, the details of each transformation were both evoked and then situated in the scaffolding of the broader context. The requirement to conserve inputs and outputs eliminated any question of missing aspects of the diagram or other design-based blind alleys. The idea of iterative exploration and definition is extremely valuable to the <synonym detail='abbreviation' tag='SDFN'>SDFN</synonym>.                                  <break/>  The Social Network Graph provides the concept of a social network<link><descriptionsymbol detail='footnote'><m:math><m:mrow><m:mo>*</m:mo></m:mrow></m:math></descriptionsymbol></link> to the <synonym detail='abbreviation' tag='SDFN'>SDFN</synonym>. The Social Network Graph also contributes a novel idea about the scope of edges. Edges in the <synonym detail='abbreviation' tag='DFD'>DFD</synonym> were simple flows of data, representing the movement of trivial signs. In the social network graph, edges can be individual communications, orders, relationships,                                  <description detail='footnote'>                                   <descriptiontag><link><m:math><m:mrow><m:mo>*</m:mo></m:mrow></m:math></link></descriptiontag>                                   <descriptioncontent>A social network graph is a mapping of a person’s relationships with other people into non-topological graph format. Each relationship is a directed edge; each person, a node. The social network graph is used in many different fields: communications, social media, and sociology are some of them.

It is possible to explore the control structures of a group by noting, with an edge, who is talking to whom. By exploring the frequency and directionality of those notes, analysts gain insights into the power and influence roles of social networks. As such, the <delimited detail='quotation'>“thought leaders”</delimited> of the small group can be identified.                                  <break/>  Moreover, by graphing flows of communication, it is possible to identify small groups within larger groups, as these small groups will communicate strongly between each other and vaguely to nodes outside. In other circles, this behavior is known as siloing [<link destination='1:Jones' location='1:Jones'>8</link>]. One design intent of the <synonym detail='abbreviation' tag='SDFN'>SDFN</synonym> is to confer the ability to identify siloing.

I summarized six to ten lines of each interview in a one-line summary. Then between three and six summaries were summarized, filtering for statements about the user’s conception of data. Although self-transcription transmits personal bias, two significant factors prevent a traditional double-blind study.

It will justify further research on the nature and subjective constructions of data from my experimental results, or else its demonstrable failure will justify not doing so.                                              <break/>  The question <delimited detail='quotation'>“Do people have different realities of data?”</delimited> defines an overly large universe of discourse, one impossible to study at a useful level of granularity in one research project. The very breadth of the question precludes the determination of any  useful and specific facts about the world besides simple exploration of the assertion that people have different understandings of data. The intent of this research and of this question is to generate interest in the research of the nature of data, how people understand it, and to demonstrate that there are potential areas of philosophy to research.                                              <break/>  I want to see if, beyond my intuitive insight, people actually have different conceptions of data or if my perception of different conceptions is an artifact of the requirements- gathering process of designing a database. It is therefore not sufficient to state that people have different understandings of data depending on whether they are dealing with it in a technical or scientific context.

In this case, I need to make sure that I am not reading imaginary meaning in the tea leaves of the results. Because this kind of external self-reflection is difficult, the question must be simplified to: Do the results surprise me? If they do not have elements of surprise, then the probability that I am projecting meaning into them must be strongly considered.                                                  <break/>  All of these are very self-critical questions, as they must be to explore the impact of an untested methodology.

It would be hard to deny that interviews I and II have data as communication, III and IV have subjective observations (with IX hinting at them) and the rest considering data as objective fact. With these broad differences evident, I feel question of interest 1 has been satisfied.                                                      <break/>  The observation constructions differ strikingly from the numeric constructions, possibly differing on a fundamental perception of reality. As one interview is trying to render the relationships between matter in the world as numbers (objectivist), another is suggesting that everything emits data and we must filter it. The conflict is records versus measurements versus signs. Does data measure objective reality, record subjective  reality, or merely transmit signs? Numbers are seen as a result of precision most of the time, whereas observations are building their way towards knowledge.                                                       <section detail='subsection' location='aut:37'>                                                       <sectionnumber>4.3.1</sectionnumber>                                                         <sectiontitle>Result 1: Data as communications</sectiontitle>                                                         <sectioncontent> Data, in the communicative sense, merely requires signs and things to communicate with those signs. The data can be rendered as bits or marks on paper, but it is seen as a factor of semiotic import rather than as something to be discovered or filtered.                                                          <break/>  This construction is substantively different from the other two inasmuch as it does not uphold data to be an aspect of reality. Instead, data is produced as a function of human intent. Because this understanding does not concern itself with interactions of the real, there is a far greater difference between this and the other two than between the subjective-objective constructions. However, the passivity of this construction allows it to accept facts produced from either source as something to be encoded, stored, and transmitted. Significant research needs to be done to explore how this construction of data relates to the other two.                                                           <section detail='subsection' location='aut:37'>                                                           <sectionnumber>4.3.2</sectionnumber>                                                             <sectiontitle>Result 2: Data as subjective observations</sectiontitle>                                                             <sectioncontent> Data, in the subjective observations, requires contextualization and filtering. Everything emits data as sense impressions<link><descriptionsymbol detail='footnote'><m:math><m:mrow><m:mo>*</m:mo></m:mrow></m:math></descriptionsymbol></link> that can be captured by us. Thus, to perform sense- making activities, we must filter and contextualize the interesting data so that it can become information.                                                              <description detail='footnote'>                                                               <descriptiontag><link><m:math><m:mrow><m:mo>*</m:mo></m:mrow></m:math></link></descriptiontag>                                                               <descriptioncontent>Like the ancient Aristotelian idea of species (particles of sensation).

There is quite a lot here available to future research, and I do not feel sufficiently confident in my sample size to make any assertions as to relationships between data and the various philosophies of knowledge or science, though the subjective nature of observations may tend slightly more towards Latour or Feyerabend.                                                              <break/>  Of more interest is that this inherently subjective data is constructed from the mind’s impressions of the surroundings, rather than revealed through measurement of the surroundings. The understanding of the embodiment of data is a significant difference between the two understandings of data.                                                               <section detail='subsection' location='aut:39'>                                                               <sectionnumber>4.3.3</sectionnumber>                                                                 <sectiontitle>Result 3: Data as measured facts</sectiontitle>                                                                 <sectioncontent> Objective data comes with its own context <delimited detail='quotation'>“baked in.”</delimited> It is, in many ways, rare: it requires positive effort to generate, and higher quality data requires a commensurate increase in effort. Data requires analysis to uncover the extant patterns of reality, and with enough data, knowledge about the singular real can be generated.                                                                  <break/>  Objective data requires that data be a fact, usually a numerical, reproducible representation of reality that conveys an understanding of measurement quality and units. Objective data is not filtered, because it is collected with prior intent and all elements of the <delimited detail='quotation'>“data set”</delimited> may produce interesting patterns.                                                                  <break/>  Both humans and sensors can reveal objective data, which is embodied in the things being measured. There seems to be no significant link with any of the major philosophies of science. Although my investigations did not explore confirmation, falsifiability, or paradigms, there seems to be a common understanding that data-as-fact accurately  represents the universe within the constraints of measurement. This may be because the participants believed data to be a building block upon which their hypotheses or understanding of the universe could be built.                                                                    <section detail='chapter' location='aut:40'>                                                                   <sectionnumber>5</sectionnumber>                                                                     <sectiontitle>Literature Review</sectiontitle>                                                                     <sectioncontent> The aim of this thesis is to ultimately facilitate better workplace communication, user interfaces, and database design and management. In order to do that, I borrow heavily from concept elicitation methodologies in order to produce personal constructs of data. These personal constructs of data, rendered in a concept map, allow for explicit exposition of the concept of data in a workplace and thereby reduce miscommunication through self-aware modification to available mental maps of the purpose and role of data.                                                                      <break/>  Concept elicitation methodologies are a subset of knowledge elicitation methods, a tool used in many disciplines to <delimited detail='quotation'>“obtain the information needed to solve problems”</delimited> [<link destination='1:burge1998' location='1:burge1998'>11</link>]. Knowledge elicitation, in the main, is focused on direct problem solving: exploring requirements and understanding the meanings of those requirements. However, by turning the techniques of knowledge elicitation onto epistemological questions of category, we can discover not the direct meaning behind requirements, but some of a person’s semiotic models of the constructions behind those requirements.                                                                      <break/>  My research looks to investigate a person’s personal construction of data. I borrow from data flow diagrams with a similar intent to the RepGrid methodology, though the end product differs significantly. The idea of personal constructs, discussed by Kelly and Tan [<link destination='1:kelly1955' location='1:kelly1955'>12</link> and <link destination='1:tan2002repertory' location='1:tan2002repertory'>13</link>] and reformulated under many names: Terms that have been used to describe these things include <delimited detail='quotation'>“schemas”</delimited> [<link destination='1:cossette1992mapping' location='1:cossette1992mapping'>14</link> and <link destination='1:jelinek1994toward' location='1:jelinek1994toward'>15</link>] <delimited detail='quotation'>“cognitive maps”</delimited> [<link destination='1:eden1992nature' location='1:eden1992nature'>16</link> and <link destination='1:weick2000making' location='1:weick2000making'>17</link>], <delimited detail='quotation'>“technological frames”</delimited> [<link destination='1:orlikowski1994technological' location='1:orlikowski1994technological'>18</link>], and <delimited detail='quotation'>“mental models”</delimited> [<link destination='1:daniels1995validating' location='1:daniels1995validating'>19</link>]. I, like Tan, will use personal constructions as the operative term.                                                                      <break/>  Kelly [<link destination='1:kelly1955' location='1:kelly1955'>12</link>] describes a personal construction as a combination of philosophy and  psychology. A construct, being subjective, is a personal epistemological tool of categorization and differentiation: <delimited detail='quotation'>“A construct is a way in which some things are construed as being alike and yet different from others.”</delimited> His thesis denotes constructs as framing devices where we can situate objects-as-signs in our way of knowing. He continues, <delimited detail='quotation'>“We have departed from conventional logic by assuming that the construct is just as pertinent to some of the things which are seen as different as it is to the things which are seen as alike.”</delimited> Here, the fact that an object is not categorized as something can be an important factor in a person’s personal construction of reality. Constructs are bipolar, admitting knowledge of the sign/concept and its opposite rather than simple negation. The <synonym detail='abbreviation' tag='SDFN'>SDFN</synonym> extends this bipolar methodology of construction construction by asking people to categorize elements as data, information, or knowledge. By articulating a tripolar construction, we not only can articulate the positive categorizations of data, but can more closely examine data as it transforms into specifically delineated categories.                                                                      <break/>  Much would be lost if participants were asked to categorize <delimited detail='quotation'>“data or not data”</delimited> as the <delimited detail='quotation'>“not data”</delimited> construction comprises everything that is not data, and is therefore not particularly interesting as a means of indicating the ontological and epistemological affordances of data. By requiring positive categorization, relationships between data and other concepts can be elicited more easily than simple negation would warrant. However, I also recognize that a a given categorization may simply be irrelevant in respect to data (relevancy is a far more useful and pragmatic benchmark than negation). Kelly notes that personal constructions are bounded [<link destination='1:kelly1955' location='1:kelly1955'>12</link>], and are not necessarily <delimited detail='quotation'>“convenient”</delimited> methods of categorization. In that light, the interview methodology will allow participants to articulate other categories that do not belong to the trinary construct of data-information- knowledge.                                                                      <break/>  The repGrid [<link destination='1:tan2002repertory' location='1:tan2002repertory'>13</link>], is a similar concept elicitation method. Tan describes the <synonym detail='abbreviation' tag='IST'>IST</synonym> uses  of the technique as: <delimited detail='quotation'>“a set of procedures for uncovering the personal constructs individuals use to structure and interpret events relating to the development, implementation, use, and management of <synonym detail='abbreviation' tag='IST'>IST</synonym> in organizations.”</delimited> While it is more overtly focused on organizational modelling, and the interpretation of events, it is a study of cognitive processes in an organizational setting to more effectively articulate information system requirements. The repgrid relies on participants sorting a pre-established schema of entities or objects, defined as a common set of <delimited detail='quotation'>“nouns or verbs”</delimited> to constructs, the framing understanding around those concepts. Tan describes repGrid concepts as: <delimited detail='quotation'>“Constructs represent the research participant’s interpretations of the elements. Further understanding of these interpretations may be gained by eliciting contrasts resulting in bi-polar labels. Using the same example, research participants may come up with bi-polar constructs such as “high user involvement – low user involvement to differentiate the elements (i.e., IS projects).”</delimited> The creation of framing dichotomies echos the construct framework of Kelly and then allows users to sort elements within those constructs with a variety of different methods.                                                                      <break/>  However, the repgrid is not the best tool for understanding constructions of data: while it does articulate a dichotomy, it fails to expose the manipulations attached to data. Elicitation of affordances and transformations of data is crucial to understanding a person’s construction of data in sufficient detail to provide useful tools designed for them. Furthermore, while the statistical reliability of the repGrid is appreciated, especially as it can be subject to content analysis through simple frequency counting, the lack of an explicit period of participants to articulate their self-schemata robs interviewers of the potential insights of an articulated schema.                                                                      <break/>  A representation grid draws on the personal construct framework for its own purposes of organizational knowledge modelling. In many ways, a <delimited detail='quotation'>“RepGrid”</delimited> is a means  of evaluating a social construction of reality, as discussed by Berger and Luckman [<link destination='1:Berger1967' location='1:Berger1967'>20</link>]. The social construction of reality echos the idea of personal constructions (though never explicitly calls out the term) by evoking the different realities of objects, <delimited detail='quotation'>“Different objects present themselves to consciousness as constituents of different spheres of reality. I recognize the fellowmen I must deal with in the course of everyday life as pertaining to a reality quite different from the disembodied figures that appear in my dreams. The two sets of objects introduce quite different tensions into my consciousness and I am attentive to them in quite different ways.”</delimited> This evocation of personal constructions framing the affordances of interaction was one of the other inspirations behind this project. While Berger &amp; Luckman articulate the primacy of our shared reality, this investigation explores one area where that shared understanding may break down.                                                                      <break/>  Shared understandings of reality as encoded as self-schemata and expressed as understandings of terms. While this practice should just as easily be expressed as a linguistic pursuit, the aim of this investigation is to uncover elements of that primal construction of reality, not in differences in linguistic expression of that construction. I have found that the best way to explore an individual’s construction of reality is to ask them to express that reality in database design. The act of rendering the real-in-mind into diagrams expressing that causes an awareness of the self-schemata to coalesce simply by bring it into the forefront of consciousness. Through introspection into cognitive activity, self-schemata are formed: <delimited detail='quotation'>“attempts to organize, summarize, or explain one’s own behavior in a particular domain will result in the formation of cognitive structures about the self or what might be called self-schemata. Self-schemata are cognitive generalizations about the self, derived from past experience, that organize and guide the processing of self-related information contained in the individual’s social experiences.”</delimited> [<link destination='1:markus1977self' location='1:markus1977self'>21</link>] It is this very process which the creation of the data flow diagram occasions in regards to an  individual’s data manipulation activities. Furthermore, it is this act of schemata creation and subsequent discussion that I aim to elicit with the <synonym detail='abbreviation' tag='SDFN'>SDFN</synonym>.                                                                      <break/>  The idea of schemata qua personal constructions of reality influencing human computer interfaces and system design is not novel. Though in the <synonym detail='abbreviation' tag='HCI'>HCI</synonym> field, the term <delimited detail='quotation'>“mental model”</delimited> is used. Wilson and Rutherford were exploring this very topic in 1989. Specifically, while they identify a significant variation in the definitions of the term <delimited detail='quotation'>“mental model,”</delimited> they generalize the term to: <delimited detail='quotation'>“a representation formed by a user of a system and/or task, based on previous experience as well as current observation, which provides most (if not all) of their subsequent system understanding and consequently dictates the level of task performance.”</delimited> [<link destination='1:wilson1989mental' location='1:wilson1989mental'>22</link>] The definitions they synthesize this from extend back into the seventies, and there is no fundamental disagreement that the practice of human-computer interaction is, in some way, the practice of presenting an interface to these mental models.                                                                      <break/>  It is important to note that there are philosophical distinctions between the terms mental model, personal construction, and self-schemata. A personal construction is, in many ways, the philosophical reality of a term. The construction provides for understanding of when and how to use the term for all use cases as well as its personal and cultural semiotic identifications. A self-schemata is the articulated and explicit epistemological conceptions of the term: it is the developed understanding of an individual understanding how they categorize and use a term. A mental model, on the other hand, is the situated understanding in procedural memory. These mental model are, themselves, socially constructed through routines in organizations [<link destination='1:cohen1994organizational' location='1:cohen1994organizational'>23</link>]. The mental model is the procedural manifestation of he personal construction in the recognized semiotic affordances of the concept of data.                                                                      <break/>  Extending the mental model to expected manipulations of data, rather than ex  pected interactions with a system is the providence of the <synonym detail='abbreviation' tag='DFD'>DFD</synonym>, though the <synonym detail='abbreviation' tag='DFD'>DFD</synonym> holds to an objective reality which synthesizes many mental models. The <synonym detail='abbreviation' tag='SDFN'>SDFN</synonym>, therefore, is a way to inspect the subjective mental models of humans as they relate to the expected interactions and transformations that their world applies to the thing they call data. As the term is never formally taught, we must evolve our models by experience with the world. Rasmussen asserts that mental models evolve with world-experience: <delimited detail='quotation'>“A mental model of a physical environment is a causal model structured in terms of objects with familiar functional properties. The objects interact in events, i.e., by state changes that propagate through the system “Kelly argues that individuals use their own personal constructs to understand and interpret events that occur around them and that these constructs are tempered by the individual’s experiences.”</delimited> [<link destination='1:rasmussen1987cognitive' location='1:rasmussen1987cognitive'>24</link>]                                                                      <break/>  As our experience with the world differs, so to must our models diverge to make individual predictions about the systems we encounter in our subjective, constructed, reality. Through articulated schema creation, we can expose a person’s mental map in a sufficiently valid framework for database designers and philosophers to puzzle over.                                                                       <section detail='section' location='aut:58'>                                                                       <sectionnumber>5.1</sectionnumber>                                                                         <sectiontitle>Hierarchies of Data</sectiontitle>                                                                         <sectioncontent> This work is not the first to ponder the nature of data. There exist two significant and pre- established relationships of data to information and knowledge: Ackoff’s and Tuomi’s. My findings mostly tend to echo the realities of data described by Ackoff or Tuomi. While not every interview or survey articulates a hierarchical relationship between data, information, and knowledge, it is clear that Ackoff’s work has entered the <delimited detail='quotation'>“common knowledge”</delimited>. A number of interviewees discussed a hierarchy of data first promulgated by Ackoff. While they never cite his influence, their descriptions of relationships between data, information, and knowledge match his quite precisely.                                                                           <break/>  Interestingly, this hierarchy has a management basis, rather than one grounded in philosophy or practical understanding of how we appreciate and use data. There are many signs of cognitive dissonance between what is perceived as the traditional hierarchy and how data is used in practice. Ackoff has updated his hierarchy many times, including a book <delimited detail='quotation'>“Management F-Laws”</delimited> [<link destination='1:Ackoff2007' location='1:Ackoff2007'>25</link>] wherein he not only states that <delimited detail='quotation'>“to managers, a pound of wisdom is worth an ounce of understanding”</delimited> but also belabors the useless metaphor with the extension that an ounce of wisdom is worth <delimited detail='quotation'>“65,536 ounces of data.”</delimited>                                                                       <break/> Tuomi presents a more philosophically rigorous conception of data in his cyclic hierarchy, with data feeding into information, which in turn feeds knowledge, which provides the ability to collect more data. In the analyses, I will refer to this as a cyclic hierarchy.                                                                           <section detail='subsection' reference='Ackoff' location='aut:60'>                                                                           <sectionnumber>5.1.1</sectionnumber>                                                                             <sectiontitle>Ackoff’s Traditional Hierarchy</sectiontitle>                                                                             <sectioncontent> The traditional hierarchy linking data, information, knowledge, and wisdom in a strict hierarchy of dominance and importance was created by Ackoff [<link destination='1:Ackoff' location='1:Ackoff'>26</link>] in 1989. In a summary of his work, Bernstein notes [<link destination='1:Bernstein2009' location='1:Bernstein2009'>27</link>]: <delimited detail='extract'>Ackoff was a management consultant and former professor of management science at the Wharton School specializing in operations research and organizational theory. His article formulating what is now commonly called the Data-Information- Knowledge-Wisdom hierarchy (or DIKW for short) was first given in 1988 as a presidential address to the International Society for General Systems Research. This background may help explain his approach. Data in his terms are the product of observations, and are of no value until they are processed into a usable form to become information. Information is contained in answers to questions. Knowledge, the next layer, further refines information by making <delimited detail='quotation'>“possible the transformation of information into instructions. It makes control of a system possible”</delimited> (Ackoff, 1989, 4), and that enables one to make it work efficiently. A managerial rather than scholarly perspective runs through Ackoff’s entire hierarchy, so that <delimited detail='quotation'>“understanding”</delimited> for him connotes an ability to assess and correct for errors, while  <delimited detail='quotation'>“wisdom”</delimited> means an ability to see the long-term consequences of any act and evaluate them relative to the ideal of total control (omnicompetence). While a scholarly perspective on this hierarchy might prioritize the processes of inquiry and discovery, Ackoff does not account for them. But his concept of omnicompetence, which refers to <delimited detail='quotation'>“the ability to satisfy any and every desire”</delimited> (Ackoff, 1989, 8), does encompass the satisfaction of user-defined needs.</delimited>                                                                           <break/> In this ontology, data are subjective observations. Curiously, despite data being subjective observations, Ackoff does not suggest any need for filtering (a common theme in subjective/observation conceptions of data).                                                                               <section detail='subsection' reference='Tuomi' location='aut:63'>                                                                               <sectionnumber>5.1.2</sectionnumber>                                                                                 <sectiontitle>Tuomi’s Cyclic Hierarchy</sectiontitle>                                                                                 <sectioncontent> Tuomi’s ontology is simple and counter-intuitive: knowledge is a framework of the world from which we build information. Information provides a local framework from which to extract data from the world. Thus, the apex of the hierarchy is data, which then filters downwards to modify knowledge and information. This approach represents an abductive approach towards the philosophy of knowledge and the research about data as the hypotheses being tested are information, generated from knowledge-of-world, rather than induced from data points [<link destination='1:Tuomi' location='1:Tuomi'>28</link>]: <delimited detail='extract'>The generally accepted view sees data as simple facts that become information as data is combined into meaningful structures, which subsequently become knowledge as meaningful information is put into a context and when it can be used to make predictions.

Obviously, it allows me a prior idea to which to compare analyzed hierarchies of data. Although Tuomi’s research is not explicitly about user’s conceptions of data, his analysis of hierarchies is an acceptable complement to it. By presenting a novel  relationship hierarchy, Tuomi challenges the <delimited detail='quotation'>“everyone knows”</delimited> mentality of much of knowledge management.                                                                                  <break/>  Tuomi’s research into the fundamental questions of knowledge is one of the fundamentals of my research, for he demonstrates that it is possible to have a different understanding of data from an intuitive-philosophical standpoint. This demonstration of difference allows a questioning of the nature of data and acts as an external source of validation for my analysis.                                                                                  <break/>  This ontology of data is supported by a study of <delimited detail='quotation'>“intelligence”</delimited> published in Nature by McNab and Klingberg [<link destination='1:McNab2008' location='1:McNab2008'>29</link>]: <delimited detail='extract'>Thus, high-capacity individuals (who can remember more information at once and who tend to do better on aptitude tests) might simply be better at keeping irrelevant information <delimited detail='quotation'>“out of mind,”</delimited> whereas low- capacity individuals may allow more irrelevant information to clutter up the mental in-box.

In one experiment, measuring electrical signals emitted by the brain enabled us to show that high-capacity people were excellent at controlling what information was represented in working memory: they let in information about relevant objects but completely filtered out that about irrelevant objects. Low-capacity individuals, in contrast, had much weaker control over what information entered the mental in-box; they let in information about both relevant and irrelevant objects roughly equally. Surprisingly, these results mean that we found that low-capacity people were actually holding more total information in mind than high-capacity individuals were-but much of the information they held was irrelevant to the task.</delimited>                                                                               <break/> The idea of consciousness as filter discussed by all of these researchers is not particularly novel, although the localization of filtering activities by fMRI to those physical regions of the brain suggests that this ontology has a closer connection to our biological minds than does Ackoff’s.                                                                                   <section detail='section' location='aut:66'>                                                                                   <sectionnumber>5.2</sectionnumber>                                                                                     <sectiontitle>Links with the Literature</sectiontitle>                                                                                     <sectioncontent> Supporting the research of Tuomi and Ackoff are Zins, Galison, and Voloshinov.

Zins, in 2003, identified areas of difference similar to those I identified [<link destination='1:Zins2007b' location='1:Zins2007b'>32</link>]: <delimited detail='extract'>Six distinctive concepts. Having established the distinction between the subjective and the universal domains, we are in a position to define the three key concepts data, information, and knowledge. In fact, we have six concepts to define, divided into two distinctive sets of three. One set relates to the subjective domain, and the other-to the universal domain. [Data-Information-Knowledge] in the subjective domain. In the subjective domain, data are the sensory stimuli, which we perceive through our senses. Information is the meaning of these sensory stimuli (i.e., the empirical perception). For example, the noises that I hear are data. The meaning of these noises (e.g., a running car engine) is information. Still, there is another alternative as to how to define  these two concepts-which seems even better. Data are sense stimuli, or their meaning (i.e., the empirical perception). Accordingly, in the example above, the loud noises, as well as the perception of a running car engine, are data. Information is empirical knowledge. Accordingly, in the example above, the knowledge that the engine is now on and the car is leaving is information, since it is empirically based. Information is a type of knowledge, rather than an intermediate stage between data and knowledge. Knowledge is a thought in the individual’s mind, which is characterized by the individual’s justifiable belief that it is true. It can be empirical and non-empirical, as in the case of logical and mathematical knowledge (e.g., <delimited detail='quotation'>“every triangle has three sides”</delimited>), religious knowledge (e.g., <delimited detail='quotation'>“God exists”</delimited>), philosophical knowledge (e.g., <delimited detail='quotation'>“Cogito ergo sum”</delimited>), and the like. Note that knowledge is the content of a thought in the individual’s mind, which is characterized by the individual’s justifiable belief that it is true, while <delimited detail='quotation'>“knowing”</delimited> is a state of mind which is characterized by the three conditions: (1) the individual believe[s] that it is true, (2) S/he can justify it, and (3) It is true, or it is appear to be true.                                                                                            <break/>  [Data-Information-Knowledge] in the universal domain. In the universal domain, data, information, and knowledge are human artifacts. They are represented by empirical signs (i.e., signs that one can sense through his/her senses). They can take on diversified forms such as engraved signs, painted forms, printed words, digital signals, light beams, sound waves, and the like. Universal data, universal information, and universal knowledge mirror their cognitive counterparts. Meaning, in the objective domain data are sets of signs that represent empirical stimuli or perceptions, information is a set of signs, which represent empirical knowledge, and knowledge is a set of signs that represent the meaning (or the content) of thoughts that the individual justifiably believes that they are true.                                                                                            <break/>  Signs Versus Meaning. Defining the Data-I-Knowledge phenomena as sets of signs needs to be refined. There is a fundamental distinction between documented (i.e., written, spoken, or physically expressed) propositions and meanings. <delimited detail='quotation'>“E = MC2”</delimited>,<delimited detail='quotation'>“E = MC2”</delimited>, and <delimited detail='quotation'>“E = MC2”</delimited> are not three different types of knowledge. These are three different sets of signs that represent the same meaning. In other words, they are three different utterances of the same knowledge. Knowledge, in the collective domain, is the meaning that is represented by written and spoken statements (i.e., sets of symbols). However, because we cannot perceive with our senses the meaning itself, which is an abstract entity, we can relate only to the sets of signs (i.e., written, spoken, or physically expressed propositions), which represent it. Apparently, it is more useful to relate to the data, information, and knowledge as sets of signs rather than as meaning and its building blocks.</delimited>                                                                                       <break/> My work profoundly agrees with the discoveries he made, though my research focuses far more on data and differentiates three different orders of data to his two.                                                                                           <section detail='subsection' reference='Galison' location='aut:73'>                                                                                           <sectionnumber>5.2.2</sectionnumber>                                                                                             <sectiontitle>Trading Zone</sectiontitle>                                                                                             <sectioncontent> Also of interest is the way that the interviewees demonstrated the idea of a trading zone. As Galison defines it [<link destination='1:Galison1997b' location='1:Galison1997b'>34</link>], <delimited detail='extract'>These considerations so exacerbated the problem [of physicists communicating] that it seemed as if any two cultures (groups with very different systems of symbols and procedures for their manipulation) would be condemned to pass one another without any possibility of significant interactions. Here we can learn from the anthropologists who regularly study unlike cultures that do interact, most notably by trade. Two groups can agree on rules of exchange even if they ascribe utterly different significance to the objects being exchanged; they may even disagree on the meaning of the exchange process itself. Nonetheless, the trading partners can hammer out a local coordination despite vast global differences. In an even more sophisticated way, cultures in interaction frequently establish contact languages, systems of discourse that can vary from the most function-specific jargons, through semi- specific pidgins, to full-fledged creoles rich enough to support activities as complex as poetry and metalinguistic reflection. The anthropological picture is relevant here. For in focusing on local coordination, rather than on global meaning, one can understand the way engineers, experimenters, and theorist interact. At last, I come to the connection between place, exchange, and knowledge production. Instead of looking at laboratories simply as the places at which experimental information and strategies are generated, my concern is with the site -- partly symbolic and partly spatial -- at which the local coordination between beliefs and action takes place. It is a domain I call the trading zone.</delimited>                                                                                           <break/> The requirement of locally true definitions applies across the original trading zones between cultures and, more interestingly, to the various cultures of physics.

Specifically, when the various participants referred to the terms <delimited detail='quotation'>“raw data”</delimited> and <delimited detail='quotation'>“derived data,”</delimited> they seemed to be using a local definition of data that did not correspond with their own philosophy, strictly speaking.

In fact, business researchers have used the idea of trading zones and some sophisticated  ideas of boundary demarcation for quite some time, going so far as to use graphs and knowledge maps (as opposed to my <synonym detail='abbreviation' tag='SDFN'>SDFN</synonym>) to identify different groups. Wilson and Herndl use this methodology when they describe their understanding of knowledge maps and trading zones [<link destination='1:Wilson2007' location='1:Wilson2007'>35</link>]: <delimited detail='extract'>The knowledge maps we created and shared with project participants encouraged cooperation and mutual understanding rather than the slash-and-burn rhetoric of demarcation events. When technical experts discuss the parts and subfunctions they have made, they get to describe their local practice, explain their knowledge, and open up their community-specific lexicon within the ecological relations of the boundary object. As they trace the lines connecting the boxes on the knowledge map, participants articulate communities of practice: each distinct but also connected through the boundary object. Because it is plastic and robust, the knowledge map balances the demands of identification and division in Burke’s terms. As boundary objects, the knowledge maps help to create a rhetorical space that is best understood through Galison’s notion of the trading zone.</delimited>                                                                                           <break/> This methodological description of their work is focused in the anthropological study of finding sub-cultures, rather than language differences. Despite this, my analysis produced many of the same results as theirs (methodologically speaking, if not with respect to content) because both my research and theirs tried to understand different philosophies/cultures with the metaphor of trading zones.                                                                                              <break/>  Just as they extend the concept of trading zone to consultants on the Washington beltway creating local definitions for a program already approved by the Pentagon, I extend the idea to how different conceptions of data interact.

In more common use, the language in a business memo may be so full of <delimited detail='quotation'>“business-speak”</delimited> that someone who is not used to the company may                                                                                                  <description detail='footnote'>                                                                                                   <descriptiontag><link><m:math><m:mrow><m:mo>*</m:mo></m:mrow></m:math></link></descriptiontag>                                                                                                   <descriptioncontent>Steganography is the act of hiding messages within other messages, where, only if you know the pattern or encoding scheme, can you identify the hidden message.

This misunderstanding is especially deadly if it makes sense within the reader’s incorrectly applied accent. As the statement can be parsed by the listener, only the mismatch of reality models in later conversations can hint at the source of the problem: the misinterpreted statement.                                                                                                  <break/>  Voloshinov believes that the evaluative accent partially belongs with the speaker, but also that there exist <delimited detail='quotation'>“side bands”</delimited> of communication, such as intonation and body language, that are specifically interpreted by the recipient of any communication, in the recipient’s context.                                                                                                  <break/>  Literal intonation has very little to do with specific constructions of data. Yet the term is used in everyday, technical, engineering, and scientific speech. The full weight of the evaluative accent, as seen in the interviews, falls into the use of context and role. While originally it was seen as way to frame ideologies; almost a post-hermeneutic way of explaining some failures of Marxism [<link destination='1:Voloshinov1929' location='1:Voloshinov1929'>38</link>]. The idea of an evaluative accent can be combined profitably with the philosophy of the trading zone.                                                                                                  <break/>  The idea of an evaluative accent corresponds well with the idea of a trading zone. The construction of misunderstanding the same language could hardly be the result of a simple linguistic misunderstanding. When a data-as-subjective-observation person says <delimited detail='quotation'>“data”</delimited> to a data-as-objective-hard-numbers person, both of them are using a <delimited detail='quotation'>“functionally correct”</delimited> definition, a definition shared by many people. They are encountering a trading zone. As Galison states, <delimited detail='quotation'>“In the trading zone, where two webs meet, there are knots, local and dense sets of quasi-rigid connections that can be identified with partially autonomous clusters of actions and beliefs.”</delimited> [<link destination='1:Galison1997b' location='1:Galison1997b'>34</link>] My identification of different conceptions of data certainly corresponds with these diverse beliefs. And those beliefs inform the evaluative accents that people use when they use and receive the term <delimited detail='quotation'>“data.”</delimited>                                                                                               <break/> While different uses of data may be boundary objects for more profound cul  tures, [<link destination='1:Chrisman1999' location='1:Chrisman1999'>39</link>–<link destination='1:Star1989' location='1:Star1989'>42</link>] this minimal investigation can scarcely provide an anthropological look into the various research cultures in existence. I can present research into the intentional creation of a local language. The use of <delimited detail='quotation'>“raw”</delimited> and <delimited detail='quotation'>“derived”</delimited> as a semiotic prefix presents a linguistic indicator to switch evaluative accents to recipients who are aware of that indicator. The practice of forming local trading zones, by repeatedly presenting symbols to the other party in an environment where people are aware that bridging must occur [<link destination='1:Galison1997b' location='1:Galison1997b'>34</link>], is the non-ideological practice of causing sufficient cognitive dissonance in the recipients for them to <delimited detail='quotation'>“bud off”</delimited> a new evaluative accent for interpreting the incoming sign-set.                                                                                                  <break/>  The evaluative accent of the local definition of a word can be understood in the context of Peircian semiotics. As Aktin notes [<link destination='1:sep-peirce-semiotics' location='1:sep-peirce-semiotics'>43</link>]: <delimited detail='extract'>In Peirce’s theory the sign relation is a triadic relation that is a special species of the genus: the representing relation.

First, their data models can correspond with how their clients think about reality, and thereby create intuitive relationships and map the computerized model to their client’s mental model more capably. Second, and in some ways more critically, they can then explain the database design to their clients in their clients’ language, potentially shortening design times by reducing miscommunications.                                                                                                          <break/>  In the same way, the proposed methodology should help extend normal modeling practice: simply making designers more aware of the different types of data constructions may make more responsive designs possible. The demonstration of different conceptions of data is important to designers because it offers another meta-aspect of reality to be captured and incorporated.                                                                                                          <break/>  I also want to create a method that can help extend <synonym detail='abbreviation' tag='HCI'>HCI</synonym> design practice. This methodology should be applicable to all sorts of design, as it is a tool for rendering  clients’ realities and not a specific kind of technical reality. The discovery of practical meaning of terms, ideas, and affordances [<link destination='1:Norman1999' location='1:Norman1999'>49</link>] of data is another tool with which HCI designers can understand how to render data presented in an interface. A tool that can make elements of private jargon explicit, and that is focused on that task (rather than treating it as a happy byproduct) can significantly contribute to the HCI design cycle.                                                                                                          <break/>  This research investigates individual constructions of data, because there is no clear consensus on the exact nature of data, much less on the exact nature of data in technical design. However, as there is no recognized domain of the philosophy of data, this research, as a more practical matter, must lay the simplest foundations for that multidisciplinary field.                                                                                                          <break/>  My basic discoveries, both methodological and philosophical, should have pragmatic results. I hope to create a methodology that improves communication and database design. I explore how we socially construct and use the term <delimited detail='quotation'>“data”</delimited>. From this investigation, I can offer potential insights into how we create trading zones between different cultures of data use. While true understanding of the nature of data may be outside the scope of this present research, the construction of a foundation is not. Any methodology created must be robust enough to provide useful observations and a compelling story.                                                                                                             <section detail='chapter' location='aut:103'>                                                                                                           <sectionnumber>6</sectionnumber>                                                                                                             <sectiontitle>Methodology</sectiontitle>                                                                                                             <sectioncontent> The field of requirements generation is heavily overpopulated with methodologies. These methodologies on the whole, generally presume that the participants are attaching similar meaning to the terms they use, especially when the terms are seemingly uncomplicated ones like “data”, “information”, and “knowledge.” The Social Data Flow Network is an elicitation methodology that can be used prior to normal requirements generation. This methodology helps to map the shared and unshared components of a group’s social construction of reality as it relates to data flows.                                                                                                              <break/>  The <synonym detail='abbreviation' tag='SDFN'>SDFN</synonym> has its methodological roots in the data flow diagram (<synonym detail='abbreviation' tag='DFD'>DFD</synonym>).

The introduction of a new methodology, especially one borrowing from many different fields, is fraught with definitional dangers.                                                                                                                      <break/>  An entity is a noun: a role that can manipulate data. A flow is a noun, representing the flow of communication or symbols between entities. An entity dictionary is a way of brainstorming entities to make the participant feel more at ease.                                                                                                                       <section detail='subsubsection' location='aut:109'>                                                                                                                       <sectionnumber>6.1.1.1</sectionnumber>                                                                                                                         <sectiontitle>Entity</sectiontitle>                                                                                                                         <sectioncontent> An entity is something that plays a role receiving, manipulating, or transmitting data. In the <synonym detail='abbreviation' tag='SDFN'>SDFN</synonym>, this act of input or output is represented by a noun described in a few words, which then have an oval bubble drawn around them. This bubble is a node in graph theory, with all of the corresponding attributes. The nature of the role is not restricted to a person or physical entity. It is anything that can be made-a-thing-of such that it makes an independent manipulation of data.                                                                                                                          <break/>  Roles are anything that can be conceptualized as an independent manipulator of data. What differentiates an interesting role from one worth skipping over is whether the role somehow transforms data passing through it. There is no restriction on the number of roles that can belong to one person or thing. Just as one person can do multiple jobs, one can also have multiple roles. One hypothesis for future testing is that the role determines the perceived affordances of data. Every role has its own unique activities and therefore uses data in its own way. As the framing of the role changes, the definition of data may change along with it.                                                                                                                          <break/>  Participants should never describe themselves as a singular entity due to ambiguity. Their description of an entity as <delimited detail='quotation'>“self”</delimited> is ambiguous to other people reading the chart, who do not understand the tacit assumptions of role and interaction from the same perspective as the participant. Instead, participants should articulate the potentially many roles that they play in an organization as separate entities. While participants self- articulating roles adds a certain artificality to the interview, the self-identification of roles also allows participants to adopt some of the framing of those roles. It is thought that the increased precision gained from artifical role distinctions is worth the contrived nature of the process.                                                                                                                          <break/>  Every role should be unique. However, there is no requirement for a one-to-one mapping from person to role. Because people and things are adaptable and can serve many roles in an organization, artificially forcing the participant to select one and only one definition of self would be contrary to the intent of this exploration. This requirement allows and encourages people to represent passing information to themselves in the guise of the different roles they play.                                                                                                                           <break/>  The avoidance of ambiguity is crucial. It makes the <synonym detail='abbreviation' tag='SDFN'>SDFN</synonym> easier to interpret by other people and it forces the individual creating the diagram to define the nature of the entity explicitly. It is far too easy to use the self as a catchall to avoid the cognitive dissonance of thinking about thinking. It is important to document discrete and unambiguous roles, even though they may map to the same person, because it is the role that understands data, not the person. Furthermore, these different roles-as-self can pass data to one another. I used the following example in the interview: An entity as lecture designer (myself) would pass requirements to the database lab developer (myself) who would pass data to the lecturer (myself). Each of those roles has different requirements for the nature of data. Crucial insights would be lost if they were all collapsed into one entity with self-pointing flows of data.                                                                                                                          <break/>  Entities however, should not be ready-to-hand<link><descriptionsymbol detail='footnote'><m:math><m:mrow><m:mo>*</m:mo></m:mrow></m:math></descriptionsymbol></link>. Devices that take on independent roles are fundamentally different from those that function as parts of another entity. The keyboard used for typing these letters into this document should not be considered an entity in the <synonym detail='abbreviation' tag='SDFN'>SDFN</synonym> sense because except when engaging in this self-reflexive behavior, the entity <delimited detail='quotation'>“author of dissertation”</delimited> does not explicitly pass data to the keyboard-rather, the <delimited detail='quotation'>“author of dissertation”</delimited> passes data to the computer for processing. The keyboard is part of a large entity and does not manipulate data in my own construction of data. Instead, as an input device, the keyboard is an extension of the computer and represents an interface for the electronic recording of symbols.                                                                                                                          <break/>  At the same time, entity creation rules should not be strictly enforced, as each person may have his or her own conceptions of what an entity could be. A role can be a                                                                                                                          <description detail='footnote'>                                                                                                                           <descriptiontag><link><m:math><m:mrow><m:mo>*</m:mo></m:mrow></m:math></link></descriptiontag>                                                                                                                           <descriptioncontent>Ready-to-hand roughly means tools that form an unconscious extension of the self. However, I will avoid a discussion of Heideggerian Daesin and other terminology.

An entity is any noun that the interviewee regards as accepting or receiving data meaningfully. Participants must define their own entities, as their own conceptualization of roles is one of the strongest sources of insight into their understanding of their construction of data.                                                                                                                           <section detail='subsubsection' location='aut:113'>                                                                                                                           <sectionnumber>6.1.1.2</sectionnumber>                                                                                                                             <sectiontitle>Flow</sectiontitle>                                                                                                                             <sectioncontent> A diagram consisting solely of entities, known as an entity dictionary, is not particularly useful. To represent relations among these nouns, however, we need flows. A flow indicates a transfer of something between one entity and another. We are concerned with the nature of the transfer instead of the act of the transfer, a verb describing how the transfer is accomplished is not particularly useful during categorization.                                                                                                                              <break/>  This expressed relationship, usually, will be a self-categorized flow of data, information, or knowledge. These flows are edges, represented by arcing lines between one or more entities, although most flows link one entity to another, singular entity. There is little objectivity in these indications of relationship. A flow represents a documented relationship, instantiated from the recipient’s understanding of reality, not necessarily a true thing in the shared reality of all participants. As the <synonym detail='abbreviation' tag='SDFN'>SDFN</synonym> is intended as a tool for exploring constructions of data there is little need to find a design that corresponds to the real world and the stakeholders’ needs. On the contrary, the subjective expressions of reality can be compared against each other to identify where areas of miscommunication arise.                                                                                                                              <break/>  Practically speaking, flows must be represented as arcing lines between one or more entities. The arc allows readers to differentiate the labels of each flow, with a clear distinction between the over and the under component. Recursive flows, which link an entity to itself, are discouraged, as they tend to represent ambiguous and broad entities.  Participants selecting recursive flows should be encouraged instead to delineate the starting and ending roles as entities more clearly.                                                                                                                              <break/>  Each flow has a label and a category. The label describes the content of the flow. The category relates the flows to other flows and ideas in the diagram. Each flow, above the arc, should be labeled with the contents of the flow. The label is a one- to three-word description of the <delimited detail='quotation'>“stuff”</delimited> being transmitted. This description must be unambiguous and unique to the contents of the flow. If two entities are transmitting the same content, care should be taken to ensure that the exact same thing is being transmitted. Minor content variations should be indicated by adding adjectives or other modifiers to the name: <delimited detail='quotation'>“Results”</delimited> becomes <delimited detail='quotation'>“Summary of Results”</delimited> and <delimited detail='quotation'>“Formal Results.”</delimited> Each label indicates a result being transmitted, but the different nature of the things changes the understanding of the thing. Reducing ambiguity is the job of the interviewer and is one of the hardest parts of conducting a <synonym detail='abbreviation' tag='SDFN'>SDFN</synonym> session.                                                                                                                              <break/>  For practice in clarifying the nature of results and in the type of thinking needed to conduct an <synonym detail='abbreviation' tag='SDFN'>SDFN</synonym> session, I recommend the game called <delimited detail='quotation'>“Zendo”</delimited> by Looney Labs<link><descriptionsymbol detail='footnote'><m:math><m:mrow><m:mo>*</m:mo></m:mrow></m:math></descriptionsymbol></link>.                                                                                                                              <description detail='footnote'>                                                                                                                               <descriptiontag><link><m:math><m:mrow><m:mo>*</m:mo></m:mrow></m:math></link></descriptiontag>                                                                                                                               <descriptioncontent>The rules of Zendo can be found here: http://www.koryheath.com/games/zendo/ The essence of the game is that players, through the use of transparent colored pyramids, must use inductive logic to find a <delimited detail='quotation'>“secret rule.”</delimited> An example of a secret rule is <delimited detail='quotation'>“A [set of pieces] [is true] if it has at least one green piece.”</delimited>  And through rating constructions of their own true and false the leader of the game describes a universe of discourse with the secret rule as the governing element. The critical element of the game, for purposes of this research, is that the leader of the game must, by the rules, refine ambiguity from any guesses the players may make. <delimited detail='quotation'>“Clarify the Guess: If the Master does not fully understand your guess, or if it is ambiguous in some way, the Master will ask clarifying questions until the uncertainty has been resolved. Your guess is not considered to be official until both you and the Master agree that it is official. At any time before that, you may retract your guess and take back your stone, or you may change your guess. If any koan on the table contradicts your guess, the Master should point this out, and you may take back your stone or change your guess. It is the Master’s responsibility to make certain that a guess is unambiguous and is not contradicted by an existing koan; all Students are encouraged to participate in this process.”</delimited>  The process of clarifying guesses to eliminate ambiguity is exactly identical to clarifying entities and the labels of flows. Besides being a fun game, it is crucial practice to get a feel for the level of precision required in the SDFN.  </descriptioncontent>                                                                                                                             </description>  Specifically, if one can run multiple sessions of the game successfully, the same skills in clarifying statements and assessing the nature of things will be used in this methodology.                                                                                                                              <break/>  The core of the <synonym detail='abbreviation' tag='SDFN'>SDFN</synonym> is the process of categorization. The <synonym detail='abbreviation' tag='SDFN'>SDFN</synonym> encourages participants to discriminate and categorize flows. By relating different flows through the use of category, it is then possible to induce the definition of the category through its flows. The category should be written under the arc. In computerized renderings, the over/ under distinction is less important, so long as the label and category of the flow are clear.                                                                                                                              <break/>  When creating the flow, the participant should first be prompted to label and then to categorize the flow according to a pre-formulated short list of categories. This list of categories should contain the most common expected categories of participants. By prompting the participant with a list, the interviewer focuses the categories on the topic of the participant’s choice. However, participants should always be able to add their own categories to this list. For example, in the interviews, I always prompted participants with <delimited detail='quotation'>“Data, Information, Knowledge, or Other.”</delimited>                                                                                                                           <break/> There should always be the option for Other. But the Other category should never remain as Other; the participant should name it. Some participants used categories such as Emotion, Wisdom, or Request. In no case was a flow allowed to remain Other. These new categories were created on the fly and used as part of that participant’s diagram from then on.                                                                                                                              <break/>  At the same time, people should not classify their own domains without any initial guidance. All but the most self-reflective will be paralyzed by the many choices available and not entirely clear on the distinctions the interviewer wants them to draw. Thus, my question took the form of <delimited detail='quotation'>“Data, Information, Knowledge, or Other”</delimited> rather than <delimited detail='quotation'>“How would you categorize this flow: data or not-data?”</delimited> Denoting sample categories creates a negotiable universe of discourse for the categories.                                                                                                                               <float detail='figure' reference='fig:flow' location='aut:115'>                                                                                                                               <floatcontent><image name='SDFNWormhole.pdf' path='Chapter3'/>  </floatcontent>                                                                                                                               <floatcaption>                                                                                                                                 <floattag>Figure 6.1:</floattag>                                                                                                                                   <floattext>A trivial SDFN used to illustrate the idea of “flows” and wormholes.

A wormhole is some symbol (usually an *) and accompanying identifier<link><descriptionsymbol detail='footnote'><m:math><m:mrow><m:mo>*</m:mo></m:mrow></m:math></descriptionsymbol></link> placed more than once on the paper. Each symbol sharing an identifier should be considered connected, which may allow for easier routing. In extreme cases, a wormhole may have one arrow leading from it to represent the inbound connections of all of the flows connected to the other wormhole. The only real restriction is that the creation of wormholes should be unambiguous and clear both at the time of creation and afterwards. Sometimes, in the case of major changes, it is better to redraw                                                                                                                              <description detail='footnote'>                                                                                                                               <descriptiontag><link><m:math><m:mrow><m:mo>*</m:mo></m:mrow></m:math></link></descriptiontag>                                                                                                                               <descriptioncontent>A character, number, or unique symbol all serve well.  </descriptioncontent>                                                                                                                             </description>  the design than to use too many wormholes.

However, not all participants may have the ability to easily understand the nature of entities. For that reason, and as a precursor to group-based <synonym detail='abbreviation' tag='SDFN'>SDFN</synonym> creation, I engaged some participants with creation of an entity dictionary, a simple list of entities that may be involved in the <synonym detail='abbreviation' tag='SDFN'>SDFN</synonym>.                                                                                                                                  <break/>  An entity dictionary is a simple, non-authoritative, brainstorming device in case the participant is unsure about where to start. Instead of starting the <synonym detail='abbreviation' tag='SDFN'>SDFN</synonym> with two entities and a flow connecting them, I will encourage the participant to imagine all the different entities with which they engage on a daily basis, to name them, and to describe their roles. The immediate feedback, both positive and negative, on each described entity teaches participants to think in terms of roles. Once they have filled a page, most will have internalized the meaning of entity.                                                                                                                                  <break/>  Through the creation of this entity dictionary, a number of interesting themes will appear, based on participant enthusiasm or repetition. I was especially careful to pay attention to offhand comments about entities or the participant’s work during the creation of the dictionary, as these comments will most likely indicate interesting topics for the interview. The dictionary should be started by encouraging each participant to name an entity that represents them in some role, and then the scope should be gradually broadened to things and people they work with.                                                                                                                                  <break/>  To those familiar with the <synonym detail='abbreviation' tag='DFD'>DFD</synonym> methodology, the idea of the entity dictionary is  almost completely opposite to that of the <delimited detail='quotation'>“data dictionary”</delimited> of the <synonym detail='abbreviation' tag='DFD'>DFD</synonym>. While the Data Dictionary is a device for the accurate specification of data in the data flows, compiled during and after the creation of the diagram, the entity dictionary is a piece of scaffolding designed to help participants think the right way about entities.                                                                                                                                  <break/>  Unlike a data flow diagram, the entity dictionary is not authoritative<link><descriptionsymbol detail='footnote'><m:math><m:mrow><m:mo>*</m:mo></m:mrow></m:math></descriptionsymbol></link>.

This requirement exists because the <synonym detail='abbreviation' tag='DFD'>DFD</synonym> has its roots as a programming design, and therefore must be able to explicitly define the data structures of a program.

This describes the methodology used in the study presented in the next chapter. In brief, the <synonym detail='abbreviation' tag='SDFN'>SDFN</synonym> begins through the explanation of terms, a summary of the ideas expressed above. If participants do not understand the nature of entities, an entity dictionary should be created. When participants understand entity and flow, a topic is chosen and the diagram is created. After the creation of the SDFN, it is used as an artifact into a short open-ended interview for self-reflection.                                                                                                                                      <break/>  The terms and nature of the <synonym detail='abbreviation' tag='SDFN'>SDFN</synonym> should be gently explained to the participant. If they seem unsure, engage in the brainstorming tactic of creating an entity dictionary before proceeding. From conversation during the introduction, the participant and interviewer should agree upon the topic, referred to as the <synonym detail='abbreviation' tag='UoD'>UoD</synonym><link><descriptionsymbol detail='footnote'><m:math><m:mrow><m:mo>*</m:mo></m:mrow></m:math></descriptionsymbol></link>. The topic should be drawn from the participant’s common work experience, to give them sufficient memories to draw upon. The pre-defined topic sets the limits of exploration and acts as a <synonym detail='abbreviation' tag='UoD'>UoD</synonym>. When those limits have been reached, the <synonym detail='abbreviation' tag='SDFN'>SDFN</synonym> is completed. During the interview, avoid using terms like <delimited detail='quotation'>“universe of discourse”</delimited> or even <delimited detail='quotation'>“ready-to-hand”</delimited> because the jargon only distracted from the topic.                                                                                                                                      <break/>  Instead, in the small chat at the start of the interview, ask them to speak about their job. Then ask open questions about <delimited detail='quotation'>“interesting”</delimited> aspects of their job, ones that involve data in some way. This casual conversation is crucial for reassuring the participant and steering the direction of the discussion. If the small talk was not enough, move to the creation of a heavily scaffolded entity dictionary, to see what entities they are most interested in, and thereby define the <synonym detail='abbreviation' tag='UoD'>UoD</synonym>.                                                                                                                                      <break/>  Participants begin by describing or selecting two entities within the <synonym detail='abbreviation' tag='UoD'>UoD</synonym>. One entity should be a role associated with the participant for ease of imagination and the other can be anything with which the participant interacts. Quite a lot of prompting will generally be necessary during this first interaction. Prompting should take the form of open-ended questions, guiding the participants to first establish their own roles as entities. Once they have described themselves, they should identify the role they interact                                                                                                                                      <description detail='footnote'>                                                                                                                                       <descriptiontag><link><m:math><m:mrow><m:mo>*</m:mo></m:mrow></m:math></link></descriptiontag>                                                                                                                                       <descriptioncontent>The Universe of Discourse is the bounded realm under investigation.  </descriptioncontent>                                                                                                                                     </description>  with as another entity, and then be guided into describing a flow between those entities. Through the use of guiding open-ended questions and the interviewer serving as scribe, each participant should create the entities, flows, label the flow, and then categorize the flow. The interviewer should never label or categorize anything.                                                                                                                                      <break/>  This process of identifying flow and entity should continue in an iterative loop until the interviewee starts tiring. Generally, the topic will be sufficiently broad for a 30- to 40-minute diagramming session. If you end earlier, repeat with a different topic in a new diagram. After identifying the first pair of entities, however, the order changes. The subject should be encouraged to identify a flow first, and then to add entities as necessary. Participants should only create one new entity at a time, and then try to relate other entities to that one.                                                                                                                                      <break/>  The graph, for purposes of clarity and ease of expression, should remain at least weakly connected<link><descriptionsymbol detail='footnote'><m:math><m:mrow><m:mo>*</m:mo></m:mrow></m:math></descriptionsymbol></link>. Isolated subgraphs should be moved to their own papers and explored as completely different graphs. Separating the graphs can create distance between the topics. This distance allows one topic to be completed and then another role to be assumed when talking about the other topic.                                                                                                                                      <break/>  The interviewer has a number of tasks during this process.

This will require progressively less scaffolding as the first few entities will provide both positive and negative feedback. It is vital to gently clarify incorrect entities and flow descriptions the moment they are suggested. The interviewer must insure each flow added is unique, understandable, and directed. Although correcting flows after the fact is encouraged as the participant refines his or her terms and understanding of the diagram, ambiguity must be caught immediately, before it can sabotage the <synonym detail='abbreviation' tag='SDFN'>SDFN</synonym>.                                                                                                                                      <break/>  The process of clarification can be seen in this transcript: <delimited detail='extract'>Interviewer: What other flows are there?                                                                                                                                        <break/>  Participant: Well, it just sends back results.                                                                                                                                        <break/>  Interviewer: Same results or are these results different from these results?                                                                                                                                        <break/>  Participant: They are different.

In the beginning, it is better to be more detailed about the nature of entities so that, by the end of the interview, the labels on flows and entities are just flowing naturally.                                                                                                                                      <break/>  This iterative approach is also useful as it saves significant and boring theoretical explanations at the start of the interview, which may bore the participant, make them hostile (as some do not like being explained to), or be redundant because they’re not listening anyways.                                                                                                                                       <break/>  The objective of the <synonym detail='abbreviation' tag='SDFN'>SDFN</synonym> is a page or two of bubbles connected by arcing flows<link><descriptionsymbol detail='footnote'><m:math><m:mrow><m:mo>*</m:mo></m:mrow></m:math></descriptionsymbol></link>. This paper graph can be trivially digitized in Graphviz. Graphviz is a graph layout program that accepts a text description of the desired diagram and then renders it graphically. The application of Graphviz to the problem saves significant post-processing time in labeling and diagramming flows. Although this research was rendered in Graphviz on Linux workstations, any program that can render graphs can be used for post-processing.                                                                                                                                      <break/>  Post-processing involves roughly three steps. First, in one file, describe the list of entities and the relationships among them<link><descriptionsymbol detail='footnote'><m:math><m:mrow><m:mi>†</m:mi></m:mrow></m:math></descriptionsymbol></link>. Entities should be defined first with distinct labels. The distinct labels are very useful because they provide a way to ensure the quality of the subsequent graph. Graphviz is quite permissive with entities. Typos in entity names in either the entity or relationship section will be happily accepted as valid input by the program. Identifying unusual entities that are not expected on the final output is a great way of checking for node validity.                                                                                                                                      <break/>  Edge validity can be checked by counting the total number of edges of each entity<link><descriptionsymbol detail='footnote'><m:math><m:mrow><m:mi>‡</m:mi></m:mrow></m:math></descriptionsymbol></link>. There should be a 1:1 relationship between the paper level of connectedness and the diagram. By counting the number of edges around each node and comparing that total to the original graph, one can trace errors in the diagramming to specific entities and then fix those errors.                                                                                                                                      <description detail='footnote'>                                                                                                                                       <descriptiontag><link><m:math><m:mrow><m:mo>*</m:mo></m:mrow></m:math></link></descriptiontag>                                                                                                                                       <descriptioncontent>See figure <link destination='fig:flow' location='aut:115'>6.1</link> .</descriptioncontent>                                                                                                                                     </description>                                                                                                                                     <description detail='footnote'>                                                                                                                                       <descriptiontag><link><m:math><m:mrow><m:mi>†</m:mi></m:mrow></m:math></link></descriptiontag>                                                                                                                                       <descriptioncontent>See appendix B page (<link destination='AppendixGraphviz' location='aut:253'>385</link> ) for code.</descriptioncontent>                                                                                                                                     </description>                                                                                                                                     <description detail='footnote'>                                                                                                                                       <descriptiontag><link><m:math><m:mrow><m:mi>‡</m:mi></m:mrow></m:math></link></descriptiontag>                                                                                                                                       <descriptioncontent>Starting from the top of an entity, make a tiny mark at the edge chosen, then circle clockwise around it, counting each edge.

There are only two physical requirements: good paper and two good recorders. A backup recorder is essential because these interviews are impossible to duplicate: as people resolve their internal cognitive dissonance throughout the interview, their answers change. It is therefore impossible to re-run the interview, though running follow-up interviews tends to be quite fruitful. It is important to prepare for all the ways in which an interview might fail. A repeated interview covering the same ground should instead focus on a discussion of categorization choices on the interviewee’s already completed <synonym detail='abbreviation' tag='SDFN'>SDFN</synonym>. The <synonym detail='abbreviation' tag='SDFN'>SDFN</synonym> should have clarified their internal thinking as to what their personal construction of data was so all that remains is to re-record their ideas.                                                                                                                                          <break/>  During my interviews, I used a mini-recorder and my laptop. The laptop, despite being large and distracting, served as an excellent recording device because it recorded directly in the audio post-processing program Audacity. Audacity is highly recommended both as an interview-recording program and as a sound post-processing program. It is important to process the recordings before transcription due to inevitable background, A/C, and RF noise. Phones should be turned off during the interview as they generate inordinate amounts of RF noise that can severely corrupt the recording.                                                                                                                                          <break/>  Ease of access is a function of recording availability and limits the utility of many mini-recorders. Extracting recordings from some recorders involves considerable effort and requires proprietary software and cords. It is important to test the full extraction process from all of the candidate recording devices before engaging in an interview. If it is not easily feasible to extract common file formats from the device, select another device. Optimally, the device will produce an mp3 audio file, as that is the de facto compressed  audio standard. Voice, being easily compressible, is a perfect fit for mp3, and many hours of recording can be stored with ease. An earlier uncompressed format (wav) is also suitable, being compatible with any modern computer. The wav file sizes are, however, much larger. Before the interview, make sure there is sufficient space on the devices for twice the estimated interview length.                                                                                                                                          <break/>  Paper selection is significantly easier. A large pad of paper is sufficient, though higher quality pads are desirable as they will tear less easily, and absorb the ink from the pens. Fast drying pens are preferred, though any tip will work. Each sheet on the pad should be labeled as it is used with the number of the interview, the page count, and the date. In case the pages are arranged out of order, this information is sufficient to reconstruct the drawing order and interview.                                                                                                                                           <section detail='subsection' location='aut:130'>                                                                                                                                           <sectionnumber>6.1.4</sectionnumber>                                                                                                                                             <sectiontitle>Timing Considerations</sectiontitle>                                                                                                                                             <sectioncontent> The interviewer should allocate around 15 minutes on both sides of the interview for equipment preparation. During the interview, another 10 to 15 minutes should be spent on breaking the ice and making the interviewee comfortable. Creating the <synonym detail='abbreviation' tag='SDFN'>SDFN</synonym> will take half an hour to an hour, depending on how complex a diagram the participant desires. Although it is theoretically possible to compile the answers for a <synonym detail='abbreviation' tag='SDFN'>SDFN</synonym> diagram very quickly, try to encourage the participant until either a page is filled or he or she is clearly horribly lost.                                                                                                                                              <break/>  A subsequent discussion, once the <synonym detail='abbreviation' tag='SDFN'>SDFN</synonym> has been completed, is completely optional. Some of the people interviewed want to reflect, whereas others, uncomfortable with the procedure, do not. Due to this huge variation, there is no standard duration for this discussion, because it can go as long as the participant would like it to go. It is unusual, however, for it to go more than half an hour. If the participant is still interested after  half an hour, attempt to schedule a second, follow-up interview. The <synonym detail='abbreviation' tag='SDFN'>SDFN</synonym> creation tends to be quite draining, and new insights may appear after a few days off for internal self- reflection.                                                                                                                                              <break/>  Preparation is fairly trivial with enough pre-interview logistics work. It is important to have liquids and treats for both parties available, as there will be a significant amount of oral discussion. In the meeting area, try to position the discussion around a corner of a table. Having large separation between the interviewer and participant is contraindicated on both theoretical and practical levels. Theoretically, it is a bad idea to introduce any sense of distance or remoteness, as it will just increase the difficulties of icebreaking. Practically, the sheet will change hands many times, and a short distance will allow both parties to read edits and additions as they happen. Normally, the interviewer will serve as scribe to render the participant’s descriptions in a common and consistent format. The participant should nevertheless see what is being scribed in real time, to offer feedback and corrections of his or her own thoughts.                                                                                                                                              <break/>  The final element of preparation is to ensure the operation of both recorders. The recorders should be positioned out of the direct line between interviewer and participant. If possible, they should be positioned to pick up the participant clearly and isolated from the table to reduce the thumps and scratches transmitted by the table. Recording devices will pick up hand movements and emphatic gestures that hit the table depressingly well.                                                                                                                                              <break/>  Have some sort of subtle timing device to ensure the interview is proceeding according to schedule. Make sure that it is possible to look at the timer without disrupting the concentration of the participant. A watch in this regard is a poor choice, as looking at a watch is a social cue for many people. Cell phones pose a similar problem (and in any case, they and other radio devices should be off during the interview to prevent transmission interference.) Try to record at least 30 seconds of silence before the interview  begins, and turn off the option on the recorders to not record white noise, because those measures will help with post-processing operations.                                                                                                                                               <section detail='section' location='aut:131'>                                                                                                                                               <sectionnumber>6.2</sectionnumber>                                                                                                                                                 <sectiontitle>Conducting the Interview</sectiontitle>                                                                                                                                                 <sectioncontent> The interview necessary to explore a participant’s individual construction of data has three phases. Initially, the interviewer should collect demographics through the introduction. The introduction is primarily a means to diffuse anxiety and to gain the critical basis for comparison between parties. The second phase is that of constructing the <synonym detail='abbreviation' tag='SDFN'>SDFN</synonym>. The <synonym detail='abbreviation' tag='SDFN'>SDFN</synonym> exposes the practical understandings of data of the participant through repeated categorization. The final component of the interview, the denouement, tends to be a discussion of the participant’s understanding of data uncovered by the <synonym detail='abbreviation' tag='SDFN'>SDFN</synonym>. As the process can cause a construction to change as it is articulated, this self-reflection period is an excellent opportunity for the participant to air their thoughts and describe their new or revealed understanding.                                                                                                                                                   <section detail='subsection' location='aut:132'>                                                                                                                                                   <sectionnumber>6.2.1</sectionnumber>                                                                                                                                                     <sectiontitle>Introduction</sectiontitle>                                                                                                                                                     <sectioncontent> The introduction serves multiple purposes. Primarily, it diffuses anxiety, explains the background of the subject, and creates a scaffold for the intuitive prompting of the <synonym detail='abbreviation' tag='SDFN'>SDFN</synonym>. In these interviews, people display many different sources of anxiety.                                                                                                                                                      <break/>  The most common is a sort of performance anxiety, wherein they do not believe their opinions are sufficiently privileged to describe their <delimited detail='quotation'>“understanding of data.”</delimited> Another common difficulty is job anxiety. Participants may feel that they are revealing secrets of their job to an outsider who, either as a spy for management or for some other reason, would steal the secrets to the participant’s detriment. It is vital, in this  stage, to reassure the participants of the intent of the interview and to make them feel in control-as they in fact are.                                                                                                                                                      <break/>  The other goal of the introduction is to provide the interviewer with an understanding of the background of the participant. This background understanding will provide for demographics and will hint at the topic of the <synonym detail='abbreviation' tag='SDFN'>SDFN</synonym> diagram. By investigating their work and educational experience, it is possible to gather data regarding any possible links between work, education, and their understanding of data. Understanding educational background is also important because it shapes the nature of the jargon used, and is an explicit way of changing vocabulary.                                                                                                                                                      <break/>  As the participant discusses their work experience, especially in relation to their understanding of data, incidents that are important to them will arise. By drawing out these incidents for any significance of data flows, one can choose a topic for the <synonym detail='abbreviation' tag='SDFN'>SDFN</synonym>that is both engaging to the participant and a fruitful for examination during the <synonym detail='abbreviation' tag='SDFN'>SDFN</synonym>. If repurposing this methodology for other tasks, at this point the task-specific goals should be emphasized, because by choosing a topic for discussion, the participant is implicitly assuming a role and engaging in a particular mindset.                                                                                                                                                      <break/>  After the participant engages in the discussion, it is important to explain the nature of the <synonym detail='abbreviation' tag='SDFN'>SDFN</synonym>. Lightly explain flows and entities, the purpose of the diagram, and the nature of categorization. This explanation should be far less philosophical than even the descriptions presented above. A flow, to participants, is <delimited detail='quotation'>“any flow of data, information, or knowledge between one entity or another”</delimited>; an entity is <delimited detail='quotation'>“a person, place, or thing that can interact with the flows.”</delimited> This is a significant point of divergence for participants. Some people will understand the nature of entities quite clearly, as shown by their body language, and others will not. If it looks as though the participant does not understand, correct that problem by building an entity dictionary. The discussion of categorization  should explain that, <delimited detail='quotation'>“The content of the flow will go above the flow. Content is roughly what is flowing between the two entities. Then I’ll ask you to categorize the nature of the flow, whether it’s data, information, knowledge, or other.”</delimited>                                                                                                                                                   <break/> If the participant is confused about entities, help them to create an entity dictionary. Ask them to describe typical entities from their workday and to describe themselves in various roles. Then ask them to describe other roles and things with which they work. The building of the entity dictionary provides the maximum scaffolding for teaching them about the nature of entities.                                                                                                                                                       <section detail='subsection' location='aut:133'>                                                                                                                                                       <sectionnumber>6.2.2</sectionnumber>                                                                                                                                                         <sectiontitle>SDFN Building</sectiontitle>                                                                                                                                                         <sectioncontent> After the participant was comfortable with the topic, and an entity dictionary was built (if appropriate), the <synonym detail='abbreviation' tag='SDFN'>SDFN</synonym> began. I avoided asking for definitions of data to avoid contaminating their categories with half-remembered definitions from their educational days.                                                                                                                                                          <break/>  The <synonym detail='abbreviation' tag='SDFN'>SDFN</synonym> is designed to encourage participants to intuitively define their understanding of data.

Because the activity of the <synonym detail='abbreviation' tag='SDFN'>SDFN</synonym> is to iteratively construct flows of <delimited detail='quotation'>“data, information, and knowledge”</delimited> between entities described by the participant as the subject-matter expert, this section will discuss the structure I provided to participants.                                                                                                                                                              <break/>  Describing a flow always began with entity declaration. The participant declared which two entities the flow is between and then declares the flow itself. My prompting for categorization changed throughout the interview. Initially, the questions were quite explicit. <delimited detail='quotation'>“Who starts the flow? What do they do?”</delimited> In this high-scaffolding variant, I explicitly identified the source of the flow and then guided participants to identify the destination and then the nature of the flow. By reducing the focus of the question to the smallest possible parts, I helped the participant not to feel confused by trying to think about too many unfamiliar things at once. Early in the interview, breaking the questions into tiny sub-questions allows for prompt feedback. As the participant learned through positive and negative reinforcement, their awareness of expectations reduced the need for tiny sub-questions.                                                                                                                                                              <break/>  I mentally examined an entity before committing it to the diagram.

If it does not exist, is the role that the participant described short and unambiguous? Entities must have short names, as names take up valuable space. If the entity bubble is more than about an inch in diameter, it takes up too much space and is likely to require redrawing the diagram.                                                                                                                                                              <break/>  I encouraged the participant to generalize to the point that the entity can rea  sonably cover all objects in its class. <delimited detail='quotation'>“Person”</delimited> is too vague; it does not give the reader any sense of what role the person occupies. <delimited detail='quotation'>“Brian”</delimited> is both too vague and too specific: it identifies a specific person, but does not suggest his role (thereby requiring more explanation) and does not allow for similar types of person. Good entities would be <delimited detail='quotation'>“Dissertation Author”</delimited> or <delimited detail='quotation'>“Casual Reader”</delimited> or <delimited detail='quotation'>“Examiner.”</delimited> They can be generalized to one and only one role; they are simple (few words), and they allow for anyone who fits that role to be classified without unnecessary recourse to edge cases. By using examples from my personal experience, I was able to consistently give the same scenario example across multiple interviews, without looking as if I was reading from a script.                                                                                                                                                              <break/>  With the source constructed, the participant needs to define the destination using the same methodology. Later, the scaffolding can mostly be withdrawn and the entire process summarized with an <delimited detail='quotation'>“And then?”</delimited> as the participant understands what is being asked. The transition should be gradual, rather than abrupt, and is predicated on the error rate of the participant. If the error rate increases, I increased the scaffolding to compensate.                                                                                                                                                              <break/>  Once the entities are identified and written, the participant should describe a flow. Using an arcing path with a clear <delimited detail='quotation'>“above and below,”</delimited> connect the two entities. These arcing lines, representing flows, are oriented to the entities, not the page. I rotated the page if it allowed for cleaner arcs and more space above and below for description.                                                                                                                                                              <break/>  With the role description in mind, the participant was asked to note what the flow contains with a theme and variations on: <delimited detail='quotation'>“This is a flow of...”</delimited> I made sure, when asking these questions, that they were as open-ended as possible. Flows also must be unambiguous. Ambiguity may be introduced via the introduction of other, similarly named flows. When a flow is described, check all the extant flows for identical and similar names. In the case of an identical name, inquire whether the same contents are  flowing. If the names are similar, make sure there are enough adjectives around the flow to distinguish the two. I edited the prior flow if it makes more sense to do so.                                                                                                                                                              <break/>  When the flow has been described, and the noun (with or without adjectives) has been written above the arc, then prompt the participant to categorize the arc as data, information, or knowledge: <delimited detail='quotation'>“And is this flow of x data, information, knowledge, or other?”</delimited>Unusually, this element of scaffolding is never completely removed, although it may be shortened as appropriate if the participant has already categorized things of its nature on the diagram.                                                                                                                                                               <section detail='subsection' location='aut:140'>                                                                                                                                                               <sectionnumber>6.2.3</sectionnumber>                                                                                                                                                                 <sectiontitle>Theoretical Discussion</sectiontitle>                                                                                                                                                                 <sectioncontent> Having spent at least a productive half an hour on the <synonym detail='abbreviation' tag='SDFN'>SDFN</synonym> building, participants were then encouraged to conclude the session with a theoretical discussion on their own revealed constructions of data. Not all participants will want to have this discussion, and beyond a vague prompt of <delimited detail='quotation'>“And would you like to talk about your thoughts on the philosophy of data?”</delimited>, it is not worth the effort to force reevaluations here. This discussion generally explores the ontological and epistemological questions and novel categorizations that arose during the <synonym detail='abbreviation' tag='SDFN'>SDFN</synonym>creation.                                                                                                                                                                  <break/>  Participants, if not uncomfortable from the unusual thinking demands of the <synonym detail='abbreviation' tag='SDFN'>SDFN</synonym>, generally engaged in a self-reflective discussion. It was vital to ask open questions that build a scaffold for the participant’s self-discovery.                                                                                                                                                                  <break/>  Of interest in the discussion are how the participant transitioned from one of the categories to another. The <synonym detail='abbreviation' tag='SDFN'>SDFN</synonym> allows for a very solid investigation of interesting questions of categorization. In this case, I was exploring how the participant categorized things as data, information, or knowledge, their boundaries, and their transitions.                                                                                                                                                                   <break/>  The main opportunity of the discussion is to study how the participant thought about the interaction between categories. In many interviews, the participants would construct a hierarchy in the theoretical discussion and discuss how data became information. The self-generation of a theoretical ontology of data from the practical categorization experience is the main purpose of this methodology.                                                                                                                                                                  <break/>  Other items to query include any departures from the normal flows. The participant, when creating the <synonym detail='abbreviation' tag='SDFN'>SDFN</synonym>, will prefer certain categories to others, depending on topic and personal preference. When given the opportunity, I tried to ask about the unusual categories: instances in which the participant either made up a category, combined or concatenated categories, or used a rare classification. For example, when certain participants strongly favored data, only a few flows were classified as knowledge, mainly because they fell outside the scope of the discussion. Subsequent conversation then focused on those flows to try to get a balanced understanding of their nature.                                                                                                                                                                  <break/>  When discussing combined or concatenated flows, it is important to understand the type of metaphor that the participant is using [<link destination='1:Lakoff2003' location='1:Lakoff2003'>55</link>]. While this is mostly important in terms of analysis, my participants normally used low key but figurative metaphors. During this process, I tried to ensure that they elaborated on each metaphor and clearly distinguished the type they were using. A container metaphor (<delimited detail='quotation'>“data holds information”</delimited>) is different from that of a concatenative metaphor (<delimited detail='quotation'>“data alongside information”</delimited>) and both are different from a combinatory metaphor (<delimited detail='quotation'>“data and information”</delimited>).                                                                                                                                                                  <break/>  A brief discussion of metaphor is in order. Participants gave me clues to their personal construction of data through their use of metaphor, especially their use of verbal affordances. Anytime the participants said, <delimited detail='quotation'>“filter data,”</delimited> it was a strong clue that they were very interested in subjective masses of data that needed to be winnowed down. Discussions of precision and accuracy, or any kind of implicit meta-data were pointers to  objective elements.                                                                                                                                                                  <break/>  An example of container metaphor in action: <delimited detail='extract'>Interviewer: ...

Having looked at the ontological transitions in the discussion above, the participant may now be prepared to examine the ontological definitions of the various categories. Here was one of the more treacherous spots of the presentation, because it would have been extremely easy to put words into the participant’s mouth through suggestions or overly specific leading questions.                                                                                                                                                                  <break/>  Instead, I tried to allow the participants to use their own inductive process on the categories and transitions they have defined. Normally, the basis of the definitions will occur in the discussion of transitions, but it may not happen in every case. If possible, guide the participants to identify and discuss their own thoughts of how they categorized something as data.                                                                                                                                                                  <break/>  Although the relationship questions are normally deeper, leading into this discussion through transitions means that the various affordances and other philosophical handles of data, information, and knowledge will be discussed first. Data, lacking form, has no <delimited detail='quotation'>“natural”</delimited> or non-constructed affordances. The reification of data through the <synonym detail='abbreviation' tag='SDFN'>SDFN</synonym> caused the participant to suggest their own affordances, and thereby strongly hint at their conception of data. The other component is to ask them to discuss their understanding of how they know something is data or of how they categorize it. The only structure possible here is that provided by the <synonym detail='abbreviation' tag='SDFN'>SDFN</synonym> itself. The participants were also prompted to explain their categorization methodologies.                                                                                                                                                                   <section detail='section' reference='MethodSurvey' location='aut:143'>                                                                                                                                                                   <sectionnumber>6.3</sectionnumber>                                                                                                                                                                     <sectiontitle>Survey</sectiontitle>                                                                                                                                                                     <sectioncontent> After the completion of the interview process, a decision to create a survey was made. The purpose of the survey would be to test two things: would it be possible to replicate the success of the interview technique in a more automated form and would the different constructions of data be evident in a more varied audience? Unfortunately, the survey suffers from both methodological and coding flaws, and is therefore presented for intellectual curiosity only. It is clearly a necessary direction for future research. One of the most critical problems is the framing of the survey, explitly asking for a differentiation between data, information, and knowledge: <delimited detail='quotation'>“This survey is exploring what you think about Data. To do that, the survey will present a list of short "scenarios". We will ask you to categorize the scenario as involving Data, Information, Knowledge, or something else, depending on your own understanding of the terms.”</delimited> Unfortunately, this posits an artificial distinction between data, information, and knowledge that the participants may not originally have perceived.                                                                                                                                                                      <break/>  During the process of collecting data, an unexpected opportunity arose: a mailing list of retired intelligence officers and agents was interested in my research. To take advantage of this opportunity, I created a survey. Optimistically, the first survey was a direct copy of the interview process, starting with a complex demographic interrogation, asking the participants to create flows and entities, and then asking them to self-direct their own investigation into their understanding of data.                                                                                                                                                                      <break/>  It was a complete failure.                                                                                                                                                                      <break/>  In the first survey pilot test, 18 people attempted to complete the survey. Only the person who had participated in my interviews had any idea of what the survey was talking about, and even that attempt produced no useful data. Most of the participants  failed to complete the survey after taking the demographics section as an exemplar of the whole, and stalled horribly at the <delimited detail='quotation'>“now describe an entity”</delimited> section.                                                                                                                                                                      <break/>  I believe the people who attempted the survey ran into two significant problems. The first, and more critical, was the symptom known as <delimited detail='quotation'>“tl;dr”</delimited> or <delimited detail='quotation'>“too long; did not read.”</delimited>An associate, practiced in survey creation, suggested that no one taking a survey would read more than three sentences of instructions. As these surveys presented multiple paragraphs detailing and defining terms, it was clear that the obstacle of tl;dr was in full effect.                                                                                                                                                                      <break/>  More subtly, though, the very abstract and theoretical nature of the questions was a problem in creating scaffolding. In the interview, because I was able to provide assistance and incremental steps according to my assessment of the participant’s comprehension, I do not believe that any participant found the process exceedingly difficult. Rather, because the survey was self-guided, its impersonality was its primary point of failure. In the interest of making a survey that people could finish quickly, I had created one that was not able to adapt the scaffolding processes that made the interviews successful. Therefore, the only people to complete it were those who already knew about the concepts being discussed: one of my interview participants, and an academic who specialized in teaching the <synonym detail='abbreviation' tag='DFD'>DFD</synonym> methodology.                                                                                                                                                                      <break/>  From this failure, I learned that a new methodology would be required. The primary lesson was that the direct translation of interview techniques failed. My intuition was that the success of the interview was based on the feedback given by the interviewer, not the structure of the interview per se. In an online survey, people expect mostly to click answers, rather than to type essays in a web form. Very few long-answer questions are appropriate to such a format, however, and a survey comprised entirely of them is wholly inappropriate for anything but a final exam. The informal nature of a survey makes  the kind of focused concentration required of long answers quite difficult, especially considering the lack of any reward besides the completion itself. It was also a mistake to establish expectations in the demographic area of the survey and then violate them on the next page through a longer theoretical component.                                                                                                                                                                      <break/>  When considering what to include in my second attempt, I could not simply consider all the myriad ways that the first survey failed. It was also important to understand the few ways in which the first survey succeeded. The two principal successes of the first survey were in the demographic section and in the tool itself. The demographic section successfully captured interesting demographic information at a high granularity. The tool, Limesurvey, performed far beyond expectations. It is well written, database- agnostic, secure, free, and open source. The mechanism for importing and exporting surveys is streamlined and very functional.                                                                                                                                                                      <break/>  A slavish copy of the methodology of the interview was clearly unsuccessful, and so any theme and variation on that would almost certainly share the same fate. I had to reconsider what question it was that I was trying to answer. In the first survey, the question developed into, <delimited detail='quotation'>“With a self-constructed <synonym detail='abbreviation' tag='SDFN'>SDFN</synonym>, can you articulate your own philosophies of data, information, and knowledge?”</delimited> The respondents presented a very straightforward answer: <delimited detail='quotation'>“No.”</delimited> The essence of the <synonym detail='abbreviation' tag='SDFN'>SDFN</synonym> is in the process of categorization. Although the interview length lent itself to a thorough exploration of the self-declared roles and their own data transfers, the essence of the <synonym detail='abbreviation' tag='SDFN'>SDFN</synonym> was in enticing categorization of many different, and distinct, flows.                                                                                                                                                                      <break/>  I realized that it was possible to remove person-specific flows and allow people to classify a general set of scenarios. I wanted to explore a specific question: <delimited detail='quotation'>“How does a specific role categorize data, information, and knowledge.”</delimited> The question of role was tricky, despite the success of the demographics section; the participants’ answers  did not suggest which role headspace they were considering their answers from. A hypothesis, while creating this, was that people would have different answers to the categories depending on the role in which they were thinking at the time-an explanation substantiated by the remarkably different interview answers one participant gave when interviewed twice about remarkably different topics. I needed to assess the person’s role, rather than just his or her generalized demographics while keeping the results completely anonymous. As the scope of the prior project was in many ways its fatal flaw, minimalism was the rule of the day in the second attempt.                                                                                                                                                                      <break/>  The survey opened with <delimited detail='quotation'>“This survey has requested that you answer it from the perspective of one of the jobs that you do. Please describe the duties of that job (in general).”</delimited>. Earlier, I asked participants to: <delimited detail='quotation'>“We believe that people can have different philosophies, depending on what job they’re doing. For this survey we ask that you think about the scenarios from the perspective of one of your jobs.”</delimited> The phrasing of the first sentence was unfortunate, invalidating the survey’s <delimited detail='quotation'>“scientific reliability.”</delimited> It is my belief that the question solicits all necessary demographic information without extending beyond the participant’s comfort zone of anonymity.                                                                                                                                                                      <break/>  The survey questions after this point all had the same format. They would begin with: <delimited detail='quotation'>“I am trying to understand what you think of as Data, and why. The questions below ask you to categorize the scenario, and then explain the categorization. Please read the following one sentence scenario. Categorize the highlighted word or phrase in context of the scenario.”</delimited>                                                                                                                                                                   <break/> Then the scenario is presented. Here are all the scenarios in order. The scenarios were chosen such that the highlighted phrase would help to differentiate between the three constructions of data found during the interviews. This strategy was not particularly effective.                                                                                                                                                                       <itemgroup detail='itemize' symbol='1'>                                                                                                                                                                       <item>                                                                                                                                                                         <itemtag><m:math><m:mrow><m:mo>•</m:mo></m:mrow></m:math></itemtag>                                                                                                                                                                         <itemcontent>Alice receives a letter from Bob.</itemcontent>                                                                                                                                                                         </item>                                                                                                                                                                       <item>                                                                                                                                                                         <itemtag><m:math><m:mrow><m:mo>•</m:mo></m:mrow></m:math></itemtag>                                                                                                                                                                         <itemcontent>Alice receives a letter from Bob containing instructions on how to build a machine.</itemcontent>                                                                                                                                                                         </item>                                                                                                                                                                       <item>                                                                                                                                                                         <itemtag><m:math><m:mrow><m:mo>•</m:mo></m:mrow></m:math></itemtag>                                                                                                                                                                         <itemcontent>Alice receives a letter from Bob containing a short story he has written.</itemcontent>                                                                                                                                                                         </item>                                                                                                                                                                       <item>                                                                                                                                                                         <itemtag><m:math><m:mrow><m:mo>•</m:mo></m:mrow></m:math></itemtag>                                                                                                                                                                         <itemcontent>Alice determines the locations for parts of a Rube Goldberg style machine to cook her breakfast.</itemcontent>                                                                                                                                                                         </item>                                                                                                                                                                       <item>                                                                                                                                                                         <itemtag><m:math><m:mrow><m:mo>•</m:mo></m:mrow></m:math></itemtag>                                                                                                                                                                         <itemcontent>Alice receives a letter from Bob.

The final section of the first survey, which asked people to write an essay on their own conception of data, was removed, the demographics section was reduced to one question, and the flow diagramming was reduced to simple categorization.                                                                                                                                                                          <break/>  While people were quite willing to answer the demographic questions, as stated earlier, I feel that the initial questions distracted from and reduced peoples’ attention span for the subsequent survey. The only demographic question that really matters is about the participant’s mindset.                                                                                                                                                                          <break/>  The new survey asked participants to <delimited detail='quotation'>“vividly imagine”</delimited> a role, thereby artificially putting them into that role’s mindset. Asking participants to engage in a specific mindset is effectively asking them to play a role: to pretend to think in ways that are foreign to their current state of mind. They retain their authentic deep expertise in the domain that  they have chosen. By engaging in role-playing, participants assume the understanding of data of that role as the scenarios are filtered through the mental maps imposed by the role.                                                                                                                                                                          <break/>  By asking participants to vividly imagine and then describe that role, the survey made it possible for them to reveal as little or as much as they wanted about their thinking methodology without disclosing potentially identifiable information. The survey gave the following instructions for the role: <delimited detail='extract'>This survey is exploring what you think about Data. To do that, the survey will present a list of short scenarios. We will ask you to categorize the scenario as involving Data, Information, Knowledge, or something else, depending on your own understanding of the terms.                                                                                                                                                                            <break/>  We believe that people can have different philosophies, depending on what job they’re doing.

This phase involved presentation of a one-sentence scenario with a term highlighted in bold<link><descriptionsymbol detail='footnote'><m:math><m:mrow><m:mo>*</m:mo></m:mrow></m:math></descriptionsymbol></link>.

Categorize the highlighted word or phrase in the context of the scenario.”</delimited> Participants were asked to classify via a drop-down box whether a given scenario was <delimited detail='quotation'>“Data, Information, Knowledge, or Other”</delimited> and, if they chose other, a text-box appeared so that they could enter their own classification. Happily, this option was often utilized, suggesting that most participants did not choose a false category of data, information, or knowledge.                                                                                                                                                                          <break/>  When participants selected a choice from the survey, they were then encouraged                                                                                                                                                                          <description detail='footnote'>                                                                                                                                                                           <descriptiontag><link><m:math><m:mrow><m:mo>*</m:mo></m:mrow></m:math></link></descriptiontag>                                                                                                                                                                           <descriptioncontent>The full survey, in printable version, can be found in Appendix A.   </descriptioncontent>                                                                                                                                                                         </description>                                                                                                                                                                         <float detail='figure' reference='fig:scenario1' location='aut:145'>                                                                                                                                                                           <floatcontent><image name='survey1.png' path='Chapter3'/></floatcontent>                                                                                                                                                                           <floatcaption>                                                                                                                                                                             <floattag>Figure 6.3:</floattag>                                                                                                                                                                               <floattext>Scenario 1 from the survey.

While it would have been desirable to have a more comprehensive survey, I feel that the second survey incorporated the lessons learned from the first and was able to produce some surprising results, regardless of its small scope.                                                                                                                                                                          <break/>  The audience for this survey was chosen very informally from three roughly distinct groups. The first group <delimited detail='quotation'>“chosen”</delimited> was from my social networks via Twitter and Facebook. This group was initially contacted to pilot test the survey. The power of social networking tools in this kind of research cannot be overstated.                                                                                                                                                                          <break/>  As the first few results came in, the survey looked sufficiently effective at capturing the participant’s understanding of data to launch it without modification. The second group consisted of the respondents to the flyer<link><descriptionsymbol detail='footnote'><m:math><m:mrow><m:mo>*</m:mo></m:mrow></m:math></descriptionsymbol></link> sent to the INTELST Forum, a mailing list coordinated by the U.S. Pentagon and Army. The people who responded to the flyer were then e-mailed a link to the survey. Very little can be said about this group, save that they are all active or retired intelligence professionals from both the military and civilian side of things. The responses from this group were fascinating, and clearly reflected a personal construction of data different from that of the others.                                                                                                                                                                          <break/>  The third group was recruited through a presentation at the company, summarizing the findings of my interview research and inviting participants to take the survey. Unlike the more focused set of my <delimited detail='quotation'>“initial trial”</delimited> group, a large subset of researchers and staff from the company was invited to my talk. This sampling allowed me to invite many distinct people to take the survey, and I feel that quite a few different jobs from the                                                                                                                                                                          <description detail='footnote'>                                                                                                                                                                           <descriptiontag><link><m:math><m:mrow><m:mo>*</m:mo></m:mrow></m:math></link></descriptiontag>                                                                                                                                                                           <descriptioncontent>See Appendix C.  </descriptioncontent>                                                                                                                                                                         </description>  company were represented in the final results.                                                                                                                                                                           <section detail='chapter' location='aut:148'>                                                                                                                                                                           <sectionnumber>7</sectionnumber>                                                                                                                                                                             <sectiontitle>Interviews</sectiontitle>                                                                                                                                                                             <sectioncontent> This chapter presents redacted but raw transcripts from the interviews I conducted at the company. The <synonym detail='abbreviation' tag='SDFN'>SDFN</synonym> is a novel methodology. As an untested methodology, and as the experiments and “analysis” were both conducted by me, the transcripts are a useful check for the reader. I appreciate the great length of these transcripts and offer excerpts in my reflections in the next chapter for readers not interested in excruciating detail.                                                                                                                                                                              <break/>  The excruciating detail is necessary, however, for readers interested in potentially implementing my methodology. Not only do the raw transcripts provide a second perspective on my methodology, but they demonstrate my elicitation techniques through the act of recording rather than my synthesized instructions as found in the previous chapter.                                                                                                                                                                              <break/>  Fundamentally, the success or failure of this elicitation method must be decided by the reader, not simply through my analysis of the results I obtained. This chapter, therefore, occurs before my reflections in an attempt to provide the reader an unbiased look at the material which informs my subsequent analysis.                                                                                                                                                                              <break/>  The redaction process sought to eliminate all identifiable nouns, some verbs, and most positions from the text. All of these items have been replaced by curly braces, a descriptor like noun, or verb, and a number. The number is consistent for every instance of that term, allowing the reader to note patterns of terms without necessarily needing the initial terms themselves. Each diagram has undergone the same redaction process as the interviews, though their quality may suffer significantly from the reduced page size.                                                                                                                                                                              <break/>  Each interview is ordered by the rough groupings of the reflections chapter, with interviews taking the same order in each chapter. This ordering is intended to support  readers flipping between chapters to check assertions or their hunches against my reflections. This order, however, is not the chronological order of the interviews, as that is being intentionally obscured to help protect anonymity.                                                                                                                                                                               <section detail='section' location='aut:149'>                                                                                                                                                                               <sectionnumber>7.1</sectionnumber>                                                                                                                                                                                 <sectiontitle>Interview 1</sectiontitle>                                                                                                                                                                                 <sectioncontent> This interview is presented in detail with annotations as a reflective case study. The technical pilot interview was the first interview conducted, and it served two purposes: to vet the equipment, and to provide a test of the methodology. After exposure to my methodology, my advocate could then use their experiences to persuade their co-workers to participate in my interview. Due to the more public nature of this interview, as well as the work with uncertain equipment, my advocate and I chose to work with a harmless topic: our mutual participation in an online game.                                                                                                                                                                                   <section detail='subsection' location='aut:154'>                                                                                                                                                                                   <sectionnumber>7.1.1</sectionnumber>                                                                                                                                                                                     <sectiontitle>Collected Drawings</sectiontitle>                                                                                                                                                                                     <sectioncontent> Please see the next page.

As we can see, the entities are just sketchy bubbles with entity names in them, which may or may not appear in later cases.                                                                                                                                                                                          <break/>  The following is my explanation of the process to the participant: <delimited detail='extract'>Interviewer: Well, we’ll be getting back to basically this question after we build the data flow diagrams. This is something to let simmer in your subconscious.                                                                                                                                                                                           <break/> Participant: Yeah it would... it’s something that we should discuss more. Yeah, there’s context of knowledge, and there’s context of data. Maybe in a superficial analysis they don’t meld. But if you think about it more deeply, you go, ’Oh, hang on.’ It’s not just making arbitrary distinction that this is knowledge and this is data. Think about, <delimited detail='quotation'>“Why do I consider that knowledge? Why do I consider that data?”</delimited> That really is knowledge because its stuff I know not just there You’re doing the Ph.D.                                                                                                                                                                                            <break/>  Interviewer: Well, yes, but I’m doing the Ph.D. based on what you tell me. So, when we’re building this data flow diagram. What I’m going to be doing is two symbols. Well, we’re going to be making circle symbol and a circle symbol will have some sort of designator that is important for you in it. It represents a person, or an entity, that communicates, transmits, verbs, data. Whatever you consider data to be.                                                                                                                                                                                            <break/>  Participant: Does that include knowledge?                                                                                                                                                                                            <break/>  Interviewer: Does it include knowledge?                                                                                                                                                                                            <break/>  Participant: Point Taken.                                                                                                                                                                                            <break/>  Interviewer: And then are going to be arcing lines sometimes with an arrow on it to another entity. The arcing lines we’ll label with whatever you would classify the data/knowledge/information, whatever term you want to do. It’s, for example, you said that there was a ’fail res’. As an example I’m not sure you would use this, one transmission of data would be you to the server, res the fort. We would label this line, ’you, server, rez fort.’ And if you want to, you could say this is data, or that this isn’t data, this is information. Whatever you think is important to define about that transmission. We’ll label that line as.                                                                                                                                                                                            <break/>  Participant: Oh, so are they different classifications?                                                                                                                                                                                            <break/>  Interviewer: There are whatever classifications you want. What I’m going to be doing here, is looking at how you classify these things, and what small groups you identify and how you think that other people classify these things. And then compare it to how other people classify the things, and look at how the perceptions shift from person to person. There’s no detail too trivial for this discussion. Because I’ll be using it to look at what other people will be doing.</delimited>                                                                                                                                                                                       <break/> In this, the theory of the <synonym detail='abbreviation' tag='SDFN'>SDFN</synonym> is not deeply explored. The important thing to do before the start of the process is to gently explain the process and diagramming techniques that will be employed in the rest of the interview. As the participants tend to be unsure at this stage, it is also important to avoid giving them definitions of data, information, or knowledge as they may be looking for specific cues to suggest which construction of data to use.                                                                                                                                                                                           <break/>  In this <synonym detail='abbreviation' tag='SDFN'>SDFN</synonym>, I did not ask the participant if they wanted to do an entity dictionary, I just started with the process of articulating the entities. It is acceptable if the participant is chatty during this process. Not only will this help to define the universe of discourse, and establish them in their own minds as subject-matter experts, but also the process of being chatty is allowing them to slip more deeply into the role they are discussing. <delimited detail='extract'>Interviewer: This is literally trying to render how you perceive the game. ... We’ll start with a circle. How would you like to label this circle? What do you think is a representation of you? We can write you here, we can write the computer here.                                                                                                                                                                                            <break/>  Participant: We can talk about me as a Clan Master. I’d put that one there. That’s to start with. I’d like to have another one, for my different roles. Cause I’m also a player of the game. Which is different from their role as a Clan Master for sure. Because they’re often in conflict.                                                                                                                                                                                            <break/>  Interviewer: What other entities can we identify in general?                                                                                                                                                                                            <break/>  Participant: Across the whole game?                                                                                                                                                                                            <break/>  Interviewer: Well, that will transmit data, whatever that is, or information or knowledge. When I say data, feel free to assume I’m also talking about information or knowledge if that helps.                                                                                                                                                                                            <break/>  Participant: That’s good. Cause often, if you get too transfixed on your own view of data, jeez, there’s lots. Like the developers. You’ve got individuals within there. Now, I guess this is when the granularity comes out, because you can talk about other clan masters as a circle. But they’re individuals amongst themselves. So I can identify. Within that, you have the concept of a clan master. There’s [Active Clan Master 1] but then they have other concepts such as --                                                                                                                                                                                            <break/>  Interviewer: [Active Clan Master 1] is a person, yes?                                                                                                                                                                                            <break/>  Participant: Person, yeah. You’ve got active CMs, which [Active Clan Master 1] can be part of this group. And you’ve got inactives.                                                                                                                                                                                            <break/>  Interviewer: Inactive CMs?                                                                                                                                                                                            <break/>  Participant: Yeah. So there’s individuals, but within there, you could break that. And then say: "Well, look [Active Clan Master 1]’s here, or something like that. And [Clan Master 2]’s here. We’ll often talk about semi-active as well. There’s me as a thing and there’s also others within, and break it down like that.                                                                                                                                                                                            <break/>  Interviewer: So what we’ll want to do here is create some sort of representation so that you can talk about classes of people. Or individually people if you feel that they’re important to be talked about as an individual. So, from this, you can say, <delimited detail='quotation'>“Well, this is a communication from me, to the active Clan Masters.”</delimited> <delimited detail='quotation'>“And I do this sort of communication.”</delimited> <delimited detail='quotation'>“Or, this is a communication from me to [Active Clan Master 1].”</delimited> Whatever  represents what you’re doing.                                                                                                                                                                                            <break/>  Participant: Look, cause sometimes -- Well, the information we can talk about, what, information, data? is transmitted. That’s why I sort of did them separately. Cause I want to transmit me and [Active Clan Master 1] will talk about something differently than we’ll talk about with others here. That can be a slightly different form of communication with these and with that. You deal with the individual differently even in a group.                                                                                                                                                                                            <break/>  Interviewer: And that’s what I’m trying to tease out here. Thank you. We’ve got you as a player, you as a clan master, the Devs. Right now, we’re just going to make bubbles and we’ll take these bubbles to a third page when we’re drawing lines. This is brainstorming.                                                                                                                                                                                            <break/>  Participant: We’ll keep it sort of then at a higher level.                                                                                                                                                                                            <break/>  Interviewer: Whatever you want to do, if you want me to draw it, I’ll draw it. If you want to draw it, go for it.                                                                                                                                                                                            <break/>  Participant: Nah, you might as well do it. So there’s other CMs then, as part of the clan. And, I’ll use that term to classify all the people that can rez the fort, per se.                                                                                                                                                                                            <break/>  Interviewer: Okay, so you define Clan Master as someone who’s able to rez the fort?                                                                                                                                                                                            <break/>  Participant: Well, not really. But I’ll group them together. There’s what we call Martini admirals in [Clan] which aren’t Clan Masters per se, but they have almost the same power as a clan Master. They can’t be kicked. But I’ll group them together. Because they’re really, as you know in [Interviewer’s Clan]. There’s either those at the top and there’s the rest of the players. So I’ll call that other clan masters. And then there’s other players. That’s probably an easier, higher level distinction up there. And the next natural bubble is <delimited detail='quotation'>“other clans.”</delimited></delimited>                                                                                                                                                                                       <break/> The other aspect of the <synonym detail='abbreviation' tag='SDFN'>SDFN</synonym> that I was teaching the participant about here was the appropriate scope of an entity as well as the desired granularity of their universe of discourse, as it is bounded by both scope and detail: only so many actions are of interest, and some actions are too trivial to diagram.                                                                                                                                                                                          <break/>  The mistakes of figure ?? illustrate the participant demonstrating a misunderstanding of the <synonym detail='abbreviation' tag='SDFN'>SDFN</synonym>, drawing their own hierarchy of authority within their organization. The creation of these side artifacts as part of the entity diagram is acceptable, especially as a way of pinpointing desired levels of granularity in entities. Participants should not think of the <synonym detail='abbreviation' tag='SDFN'>SDFN</synonym> as a hierarchy.                                                                                                                                                                                           <break/>  The start of the <synonym detail='abbreviation' tag='SDFN'>SDFN</synonym> can be quite subtle. In <link destination='fig:bubble3' location='aut:152'>figure 7.2</link>, the rezzing the fort <synonym detail='abbreviation' tag='SDFN'>SDFN</synonym>began as a <delimited detail='quotation'>“walk me through the process:”</delimited><delimited detail='extract'>Participant: So the next would be -- Maybe if I described the process ...                                                                                                                                                                                            <break/>  Interviewer: Walk me through the process.                                                                                                                                                                                            <break/>  Participant: Well, this is the case. I say <delimited detail='quotation'>“It’s time clan war.”</delimited> This is where I bring in the extra bubbles.                                                                                                                                                                                            <break/>  Interviewer: Let’s trace this and see where we get off these bubbles from the process.                                                                                                                                                                                            <break/>  Participant: We’re at clan war. <delimited detail='quotation'>“I want to rez the fort.”</delimited> A command to rez the fort, it sends me back.

The process of diagramming a single process is about the right complexity for an <synonym detail='abbreviation' tag='SDFN'>SDFN</synonym>. As we can see, the advent of a second <synonym detail='abbreviation' tag='SDFN'>SDFN</synonym> in Case-4 meant that the process of <delimited detail='quotation'>“rezzing the fort”</delimited> was a little too simple. It costs nothing to make a second diagram if there is sufficient time remaining.                                                                                                                                                                                          <break/>  The other important element is the requirement of asking questions. The point of the interview is to tease out the understanding of the participant, and to do that, they have to keep talking. Open questions, confirmations, and other prompts keep them talking without guiding down them any specific direction. <delimited detail='extract'>Interviewer: So what we’ll want to do here is create some sort of representation so that you can talk about classes of people. Or individually people if you feel that they’re important to be talked about as an individual. So, from this, you can say, "Well, this is a communication from me, to the active Clan Masters." "And I do this sort of communication." "Or, this is a communication from me to [Active Clan Master 1]." Whatever represents what you’re doing.                                                                                                                                                                                            <break/>  Participant: Look, cause sometimes -- Well, the information we can talk about, what, information, data? is transmitted. That’s why I sort of did them separately. Cause I want to transmit me and [Active Clan Master 1] will talk about something differently than we’ll talk about with others here. That can be a slightly different form of communication with these and with that. You deal with the individual differently even in a group.                                                                                                                                                                                            <break/>  Interviewer: And that’s what I’m trying to tease out here. Thank you. We’ve got you as a player, you as a clan master, the Devs. Right now, we’re just going to make bubbles and we’ll take these bubbles to a third page when we’re drawing lines. This is brainstorming.                                                                                                                                                                                            <break/>  Participant: We’ll keep it sort of then at a higher level.                                                                                                                                                                                             <break/>  Interviewer: Whatever you want to do, if you want me to draw it, I’ll draw it. If you want to draw it, go for it.                                                                                                                                                                                            <break/>  Participant: Nah, you might as well do it. So there’s other CMs then, as part of the clan. And, I’ll use that term to classify all the people that can rez the fort, per se.                                                                                                                                                                                            <break/>  Interviewer: Okay, so you define CM as someone who’s able to rez the fort?                                                                                                                                                                                            <break/>  Participant: Well, not really. But I’ll group them together. There’s what we call MA in [Clan] which aren’t Clan Masters per se, but they have almost the same power as a clan Master. They can’t be kicked. But I’ll group them together. Because they’re really, as you know in [Interviewer’s Clan]. There’s either those at the top and there’s the rest of the players. So I’ll call that other clan masters. And then there’s other players. That’s probably an easier, higher level distinction up there. And the next natural bubble is "other clans."                                                                                                                                                                                            <break/>  Interviewer: So I’ve got other clan players, and then other clans?                                                                                                                                                                                            <break/>  Participant: Um. No, I would put them together, so just other clans.                                                                                                                                                                                            <break/>  Interviewer: What about other clan masters?

I’m going through the process of rezzing the fort, which is a common thing we want to do.                                                                                                                                                                                            <break/>  Interviewer: So shall we label this rezzing the fort?                                                                                                                                                                                            <break/>  Participant: So I’m telling them, I’m sending them information. That they can now war. That they can start.                                                                                                                                                                                            <break/>  Interviewer: And so this is a what? Is this a status, is this a command, is this something else?                                                                                                                                                                                             <break/>  Participant: It’s information because it does require context. But it’s like a status it’s saying: "you can now war. We can start fighting.                                                                                                                                                                                            <break/>  Interviewer: So it’s a status.

We obviously maintain that they’re sending stuff back to me.                                                                                                                                                                                            <break/>  Interviewer: What are they doing there?                                                                                                                                                                                            <break/>  Participant: The line going back. They’re sending me, also status updates. Whether they’re ready to play, whether they’re there. How much AP they have and things like that.                                                                                                                                                                                            <break/>  Interviewer: And they’re sending you these as?                                                                                                                                                                                            <break/>  Participant: textual information.                                                                                                                                                                                            <break/>  Interviewer: So its text information?                                                                                                                                                                                            <break/>  Participant: Received via MSN.                                                                                                                                                                                            <break/>  Interviewer: Do we want to have MSN here or is MSN not at this level?                                                                                                                                                                                            <break/>  Participant: No, MSN is at that level. I’d say it is. I see MSN as -- it’s true, these would in essence, I don’t see them as MSN. MSN is a like a tool or a spanner. As an intermediary because I send it here (MSN bubble) and then to there (Player bubble.) And that is true because I don’t talk directly to them, per se.                                                                                                                                                                                            <break/>  Interviewer: MSN for information communications?                                                                                                                                                                                            <break/>  Participant: It can be annoying if MSN is down, because we lose the ability to communicate.                                                                                                                                                                                            <break/>  Interviewer: Now, does battlestations use MSN as an information conduit?                                                                                                                                                                                            <break/>  Participant: No                                                                                                                                                                                            <break/>  Interviewer: So, how can we differentiate these?                                                                                                                                                                                            <break/>  Interviewer: What other flows are there?                                                                                                                                                                                            <break/>  Participant: Add myself now, as the player bubble.

Who’s up?" "No one’s showing up. Shit I don’t want to do this." It’s that sort of... group 8-10 people on the list that communicate. So it’s not even like... I’m certainly not sending commands. I’m not really sending data. I’m sort of sending messages.

We’ve got a flow of data that are commands. Here we have a bi-directional flow of knowledge that is organization? But it’s not the organization that you’re... what category of knowledge is this?

Sharing knowledge? It really is sharing. That’s what I said.                                                                                                                                                                                            <break/>  Interviewer: There’s a process of sharing that goes on before and during the rezzing of the fort process?                                                                                                                                                                                            <break/>  Participant: Yeah. It’s primarily before. It’s certainly part of the thing. That is not the complete picture. It doesn’t just happen on its own.

All other reflections for other interviews can be found in the next chapter.                                                                                                                                                                                               <break/>  Participant used the term information to describe a communication of meaning. In this interview, the term was used to describe communications of <delimited detail='quotation'>“status.”</delimited> In the sense of the diagram, status is ambiguous. Because people describe their status to the people in charge, it is a communication between people and not a technical communication. Yet it is also the game reporting the status of the data representation of the player to the player. Supporting this, the term <delimited detail='quotation'>“information”</delimited> describes communications that are explicitly privileged above data.                                                                                                                                                                                              <break/>  Participant used the term knowledge to refer to expertise. Knowledge can be shared and is asserted to be a communicable view of reality. The players in charge of the group of players explicitly engage in knowledge sharing, and impart that view of reality to their apprentices.                                                                                                                                                                                              <break/>  Participant, in the SDFN diagram, seemed to use data to refer to contextless communications. These communications can originate from a computer or a person, but they fall into two significant categories: activity causing and unprivileged.                                                                                                                                                                                              <break/>  In the activity-causing context, participant described communications to people and computers. While communications from computers are information, the commands to the computer are data to the game, and explicitly contextless. Data can also be transmitted to a person and is a simple alert designed to cause activity. Curiously, in the same category, messages from the players in charge to the rest of the group are also data. They seem to be contextless and simple instructions. There seems to be a different ontological structure between commands to the game and commands to the players, despite both being described as <delimited detail='quotation'>“data.”</delimited>                                                                                                                                                                                           <break/> The unprivileged communications context seems to be attached to communications where the senders cannot know what they are talking about. In a sense, such a communication must be viewed with skepticism: it is a minor or inferior form of informa  tion without reliability. In this context, it describes communications from apprentices to the people in charge. Participant believed they do not know enough to offer information. As such, their communications are only data, explicitly described as <delimited detail='quotation'>“opinions”</delimited> that do not have any basis for action.                                                                                                                                                                                              <break/>  The SDFN diagram suggests that the participant has two different understandings of data simultaneously and suggests no way to reconcile the two.                                                                                                                                                                                               <section detail='section' location='aut:156'>                                                                                                                                                                                               <sectionnumber>7.2</sectionnumber>                                                                                                                                                                                                 <sectiontitle>Interview 2</sectiontitle>                                                                                                                                                                                                 <sectioncontent> <delimited detail='extract'>Participant: So we can do a typical Information request for example.

It’s because they’ve had Information, and they’ve analyzed it. So that’s the tool for them to operate. It’s like somebody else coming in with just having some Information.

And even that name was an interesting name, because it was felt that the invent, although a very clever person, was not a good position 41 of people. So they needed somebody who could come in and noun 41 the project. And, of course, keep the position 101 happy at the same time. So there’s a little bit of interesting stuff there. It was fine, I did never fight with the position 101, we both fought others together.                                                                                                                                                                                                        <break/>  Interviewer: So we’ve got the position 100, we’ve got...                                                                                                                                                                                                        <break/>  Participant: So there was a group 104 that the position 100 was the leader of.

We’re talking about a time before there was personal computers, before there was e-mail. And so, there were of course, telephones, etc.. So we sat together. Typically, we would talk for a period each day about what we were trying to do and who was doing what.                                                                                                                                                                                                        <break/>  Interviewer: Let’s model that talk. That thing is, even though you’re sitting together, there are flows of stuff. When you’re sitting together in his meeting each day and you’re talking to each other.

So we were developing verb 102. Then there was another thing early on with equipment verb 52. It was quite important to get the right equipment because the aim that we were heading for, that we realized we were heading for, was some kind of automated noun 75. It was agreed without having been proved, that the position 101, he had the ability to control the noun 103 better than the normal position 90s. He said it I do it by using the noun 111, and I use the noun 111 this way. People were suspicious and thought that he was taking more cues than were actually in the noun 111 and people wanted to say: “Can a machine understand this noun 111? and can a machine take the same kind of noun 97 changes?”                                                                                                                                                                                                        <break/>  Interviewer: Let’s look at the very trivial equipment verb 52.

And they can question any decision.                                                                                                                                                                                                        <break/>  Interviewer: position 100 back... So you’re assembling this. Are there flows of stuff there, perhaps to yourself or yourself in other roles?                                                                                                                                                                                                        <break/>  Participant: I think in this particular case there were lots of flows of things, because in the group 104, in the main group 104, there was a position 106, a position 107. I’ll call him the position 107. There was the position 101 and there was the position 108. Now, we all had to work together and my job was to lubricate all of these things to make sure that everything was happening correctly. There was a natural suspicion of the position 101 with the position 107. The position 101 and I were pretty reasonable friends. The position 108 and I were pretty reasonable friends. And for a lot of the time the position 107 and I were pretty reasonable friends. We never got to be enemies, but we got a little bit separated. There was a bit of tension across this way, and it was my job to make sure that everything happened as it should happen. The position 101 couldn’t do the noun 109. And the position 107, wanted to be acknowledged for being a position 107 and didn’t necessarily want to get ... he wanted to be a bit more of the -- not necessarily to delve into the depths of the detail. A bit more of an adviser. And the position 108 just wanted to get on with it. Which is exactly the right sort of person to have. And it was my job to work on each of those issues. As I mentioned to you, this issue of noun 110 in this noun 111 was a tremendously important part of this endeavor, so I’ll talk about that a bit more. Things like knowing the hardware and so fort that the group wants, we dealt with it. We worked out what we wanted and the group 105 gave it to us, etc.. But with this -- with respect to noun 110. ... The noun 111 had various shapes that you could observe by eye .... And the noun 110 thing became a classification thing. Now, in the early days of this, the best we could get to was about 65                                                                                                                                                                                                         <break/>  ...                                                                                                                                                                                                        <break/>  Interviewer: Your conjectures...

That’s who they were. You’re asking me what their roles were? The position 107 was mainly a position 115 of the current verb 112 technology. The position 101 was very passive. So it was a passive role, but I don’t know if I could put another word to it. Write down passive until we get to another word. And the position 108 was basically a supporter of the idea that we needed to change.                                                                                                                                                                                                        <break/>  Interviewer: Did any of them play multiple roles?                                                                                                                                                                                                        <break/>  Participant: So I played a multiple role. Those two roles. And I think actually our roles were changing during the day. .... And then I became the position 114 of that method. At the end of that meeting, I was very much an position 114 of that method. It’s more perhaps part of the position 113 role. I had to keep this meeting to be constructive. A few, I think can remember, a few pretty straight truths were told to each other at various times of the meeting, but it was in a constructive way. The position 101 was pretty passive. He was wanting, quietly, everything to move to a new state. ... And the position 108 who was supporting it again was wanting to make sure that we got. I think there was probably in the three people, myself the position 108 and the position 101, we were all probably coming into the meeting thinking that the position 107 needed to move ground a little bit. There was this element of coercion, subtly there.                                                                                                                                                                                                        <break/>  Interviewer: Let’s start by looking at some of the flows of the meeting.

I would, as position 113, would have asked the position 107/position 115 to just give us an update on where he was getting to.                                                                                                                                                                                                         <break/>  Interviewer: That request for update, should we call it request for update or something else?                                                                                                                                                                                                        <break/>  Participant: Call for Information, I think, maybe Knowledge.

He was trying not to be on one side or the other. As position 113, I should have been that way too. As position 113, I was in that role, but in my position 114 role, I was pushing my own...                                                                                                                                                                                                        <break/>  Interviewer: In that case, who do you think was picking up these nonverbal cues.                                                                                                                                                                                                        <break/>  Participant: I think everybody picks up the nonverbal cues.

At this stage, we’ve worked with each other for a long time.                                                                                                                                                                                                        <break/>  Interviewer: These non-verbal cues, Data, Information, Knowledge, other?                                                                                                                                                                                                        <break/>  Participant: Mostly Data, I think.                                                                                                                                                                                                        <break/>  Interviewer: So the position 115, in his progress update is spewing out all kinds of stuff, and you called for a progress update. You say “position 115, give me a progress update.” probably in nicer tones.                                                                                                                                                                                                        <break/>  Participant: I think we all gave progress updates, he wasn’t the only one.                                                                                                                                                                                                        <break/>  Interviewer: Did all of you give the same coordinated... set of flows?                                                                                                                                                                                                        <break/>  Participant: I think so. So the person I called the position 115, the position 107. The position 108 gave his update, and I think the position 101 probably talked about the things he was particularly interested in. What he was doing was opening up a new idea. He was sort of thinking this other idea doesn’t work, let’s try something out.                                                                                                                                                                                                        <break/>  Interviewer: So they all set progress updates to the position 113?                                                                                                                                                                                                        <break/>  Participant: To the meeting.

So we have position 113 to position 115 going “Call for progress” That’s something, but we don’t know what that thing is yet. Do you have any intuitions?                                                                                                                                                                                                        <break/>  Participant: I don’t know. It’s not -- I’m thinking it’s a lower level thing, really. It’s somewhere down -- it might just be Data.                                                                                                                                                                                                        <break/>  Interviewer: The position 115 to the meeting sent?

And what we were talking about then was what was called the learning set. So of these X noun 116s or Y noun 116s, however many there were, what had been done in the past was that the expert, our position 101, would say that this set of squiggles is 1a and this set is 3c. And the squiggles were something that, ... we’re not necessarily particularly perfect. But then, around that time, we had just got our automatic data logging stuff. And we could see what these squiggles looked like on a screen spread out. And so, as we started to talk through these things, I think that the position I put to everybody was: if the learning set isn’t perfect, how can we expect the recognizer to get it right? The basic thing that was said was: let’s use our new equipment ..., and we will get things that we believe are absolutely perfect examples for the full period of the window and they will be our new learning set. There was no loss of face in terms of the methodology, the learning set was improved because we now were able to see it for what it was really with our new equipment. I think that really was the difference between the position 107 and those of us who were working a little bit more in the field. Was that the position 107 was thinking of this as much more abstract way, and we were saying, hey, this is ... And so that was really the difference and we said that probably within a couple of days we had assembled a new learning set and we had gone from 65                                                                                                                                                                                                        <break/>  Interviewer: You as position 114 had a moment of clarity that you transmitted to the meeting.                                                                                                                                                                                                        <break/>  Participant: Yes.                                                                                                                                                                                                        <break/>  Interviewer: This moment of clarity, Data, Information, Knowledge?                                                                                                                                                                                                         <break/>  Participant: It came out as Data.                                                                                                                                                                                                        <break/>  Interviewer: So you communicated this moment of clarity as Data.                                                                                                                                                                                                        <break/>  Participant: It’s one of those things that people who are a little more extroverted tend to speak before they think.

I had my moment of clarity, I threw that into the meeting, we talked about it a lot. I think that the position 107 wasn’t sure about it at all. And he was actually pretty concerned that it wouldn’t be right. Because in all the books that he read, you get the expert to classify, and we were saying the expert isn’t good enough to classify even though he invented this.  Fortunately, the expert agreed himself that maybe that was true. We said “we can classify better if we can see it clearer.”                                                                                                                                                                                                        <break/>  Interviewer: Did you just persuade him with nonverbal cues? Or?                                                                                                                                                                                                        <break/>  Participant: I think that there was a very logical argument. So that, we’re talking about all the people in the room scientific techo types that you’re familiar with. People respond to a logical argument. I don’t want to estimate non-verbal, because most of us techos most often think nonverbal doesn’t even exist. I think, at the time, I certainly would have said that logical argument prevailed.                                                                                                                                                                                                        <break/>  Interviewer: Who put the logical argument to whom?                                                                                                                                                                                                        <break/>  Participant: I think that what happened, it’s interesting now that we’ve written it on here. Once I had this moment of clarity, one of only a few in my lifetime, I was advocating that, because I could see it really clearly, and it was only a few minutes afterwards that I saw it as an axiom, that it was so clear that we needed to try this. Then the position 108/supporter, he was jumping on board. And he was saying “Yeah, I think it’s a good idea and I know how to help to do this. Here’s this.” The position 107 wasn’t sure because I don’t think he was really defending something as much as saying: “I’m not sure, I’m not sure.” But I think probably the logical argument was: we actually have the tools to do this now, we’re not going to be waiting months to try it, we’re can try it tomorrow, and who knows? And that would have been the persuading things.                                                                                                                                                                                                        <break/>  Interviewer: and you as position 114 persuaded the position 115?                                                                                                                                                                                                        <break/>  Participant: the meeting persuaded. I think that as I mentioned early on, I actually had pretty good relationships with all of these people 1:1. But there was not such a good relationship here or here, and so maybe I was helping everything to come on board because of the personal relationship side of it.                                                                                                                                                                                                        <break/>  Interviewer: So we’ve got logical argument: Data, Information, Knowledge? What is this logical argument thing?                                                                                                                                                                                                        <break/>  Participant: I don’t know how we’d classify theoretical... it is one of those things that you might receive Data, but the Data are all naturally clicking to gear in the receiver’s mind.                                                                                                                                                                                                        <break/>  Interviewer: Let’s look at that. You say that you receive Data, and that the receiver’s mind “clunk clunk clunk.” So... that set of organized, structured data, that really comprises a logical argument. “Given this, this, that, ...”                                                                                                                                                                                                        <break/>  Participant: As soon as you say organized structured Data, which is exactly what it is, it starts to become Information.                                                                                                                                                                                                        <break/>  Interviewer: We would say that this logical argument as a collection of ordered, structured, Data is Information?                                                                                                                                                                                                        <break/>  Participant: Yes, I think so. I think that’s where that changed. Because, at my moment of clarity, it was probably better that I threw this into the  meeting as Data. And then we all started clunking, clunking, clunking with it, which meant that this wasn’t seen as me -- my thing, because we all worked on it. But, as I say, it didn’t take me very long, where this in my own mind had gone from an idea to being an axiom. Which, fortunately, proved to be true.                                                                                                                                                                                                        <break/>  Interviewer: so we’ve got this logical argument from the meeting as Information to the position 115. But you also mentioned that you had a personal relationship between position 114 and position 115.                                                                                                                                                                                                        <break/>  Participant: and that was just in terms of, mainly an out of work hobby. So I had quite a good relationship with him.                                                                                                                                                                                                        <break/>  Interviewer: This personal relationship. Would you say that the drawing on this background, basically going: “I’m going to persuade you, because you know that I’m not completely full of it because of our personal relationship.” would you say that persuasive technique is drawing on or communicating Data, Information, or Knowledge?                                                                                                                                                                                                        <break/>  Participant: It’s certainly got an organization to Data, at least. Whether it goes further than that, I don’t know how these things are classified. I’m a bit unsure about how to deal with that. It’s beyond data.                                                                                                                                                                                                        <break/>  Interviewer: Is it Information?                                                                                                                                                                                                        <break/>  Participant: I think he would have used it as Information.                                                                                                                                                                                                        <break/>  Interviewer: He perceived the flow as Information. Because, he saw it as “here’s this guy, I trust this guy because of our shared hobby. He’s calling upon that shared trust to persuade me in this meeting. And he would see that as Information.                                                                                                                                                                                                        <break/>  Participant: I don’t think that, for this meeting, that would have been a major factor. Okay? It might have been that straw that eventually... “Yes, we’ll do it.” I think that what he was -- he did tend to sometimes defend himself. I think, in this meeting, he was actually defending what he -- knowledge of the technique. And he didn’t want the technique to be bastardized in any way.                                                                                                                                                                                                        <break/>  Interviewer: The meeting produced conclusions, these conclusions were Knowledge. Did anyone else produce Knowledge?                                                                                                                                                                                                        <break/>  Participant: I imagine that various people quoted Knowledge.                                                                                                                                                                                                        <break/>  Interviewer: They communicated their Knowledge that wasn’t theirs. Who would have done that?                                                                                                                                                                                                        <break/>  Participant: I certainly think the position 107/position 115 would have done that. Because, to some extent, his reticence to try new things was on the basis of his Knowledge.                                                                                                                                                                                                        <break/>  Interviewer: So he was communicating his Knowledge to the meeting... And the Knowledge was, status quo?                                                                                                                                                                                                        <break/>  Participant: I think it was about the state of the art of these techniques and that sort of thing. I think similarly the position 101 would have been from time to time, injecting his Knowledge of noun 117 into the meeting. And the position 108 as well, Knowledge of programming.  He would have been helping the meeting with the Knowledge of programming, because we had to use programming as a tool. These are all kind of constraints to how it is. I might have even been communicating Knowledge of group 130. position 113. So, in a way, although one is communicating Knowledge, you can possibly be communicating it as Data for everybody to churn around with.                                                                                                                                                                                                        <break/>  ....                                                                                                                                                                                                        <break/>  Interviewer: Does Data become Information or Knowledge?                                                                                                                                                                                                        <break/>  Participant: Coming into this interview, I thought that the hierarchy was Data, Information, Knowledge. Maybe wisdom or something above that. Or something crazy like that. Way out there. During the meeting, I think I... with your ... nondirectional coaching, you helped me to see where things were probably Data, where those Data were used by others to form Information. And then, pieces of Information, there’s something higher above Information.                                                                                                                                                                                                        <break/>  Interviewer: So Information becomes Knowledge?                                                                                                                                                                                                        <break/>  Participant: I think it’s can become Knowledge.                                                                                                                                                                                                        <break/>  Interviewer: Do any of these mediate any of the others?                                                                                                                                                                                                        <break/>  Participant: Can you run that by in a different method?                                                                                                                                                                                                        <break/>  Interviewer: Before I do that.

I’m not real sure. I think that the analogy I’ve got in my own mind here is something along the lines of: “I’ve got a Newton’s first law of motion or something in my mind, and I see the Data coming in, assembling it to some extent, and suddenly it fits that model of that, so the Data is almost become Knowledge without going through the Information.                                                                                                                                                                                                        <break/>  Interviewer: You have a model in your head.

That’s not very intuitive is it? So you were exactly right. And I would say, you put more ... in, you can’t, because the top of the Noun 2 will go cold. And I only know that it goes cold because I understand the heat and mass balance of the Noun 2.                                                                                                                                                                                                        <break/>  Interviewer: So telling me that simple stuff: Stuff goes in the top, stuff goes in the bottom, you would say that you’re communicating to me...                                                                                                                                                                                                        <break/>  Participant: That’s more Information.

I’m imparting my Knowledge. But a general description is hardly Knowledge.                                                                                                                                                                                                        <break/>  Interviewer: What are you giving me in that jargon?                                                                                                                                                                                                        <break/>  Participant: I think it’s more or less somewhere between Data and Information.

If they genuinely don’t know, they probably tell you. This comes up in a few different forums. If they know something and it’s happened in this project -- and if they know something  is potentially a problem for you but you haven’t encountered it yet, they won’t tell you. When you have the problem if you ask the question the wrong way, they won’t tell you. So it can be quite frustrating to do a whole pile of work and go "We found this, this, and this, and our explanation is this" "Yes, we saw this last year on this other noun 60 that’s not yours." "Did you think to tell us?" "You didn’t ask." ... But the form is those questions: "[company] has a this. We see this, this, and this. What is your experience?" ... What should happen is that they do some analysis on that data, informed hopefully by our Knowledge, and they return to us their analysis and explanation.                                                                                                                                                                                                            <break/>  Interviewer: Do we want to have separate flows for these?                                                                                                                                                                                                            <break/>  Participant: Might as well.                                                                                                                                                                                                            <break/>  Interviewer: Analysis, explanation.

We’d like this box to have all the same properties everywhere. However, since once of the purposes is a noun 80: if there’s new noun 80 material being introduced ... and old noun 80 material ..., it’s not going to be uniform .... We’d like to know about capacity and flows and stuff like that.

If over time this happens and it’s the noun 81, we can have higher noun 74 at the top and lower noun 74 at the bottom. There are two ways to interpret this. One is, in my opinion, wrong. [explanation of model] And we justify this decision from numerical modeling. We can actually then independently create a numerical model which is consistent with that explanation. The alternate, incorrect view, is [alternate explanation] ... will give you the right answer most of the time. It’s a nice rule of thumb. noun 83s just happen to be different. And the difficult thing for us was, until we constructed a numerical model and said look: this numerical model starts off with the ... equations about the universe and it’s entirely self consistent and look it’s the same result. That was something which helped us convince people that well, yes, that is consistent with the noun 60 measurements. And my explanation is not consistent with the laws of the  universe. "OK, you’re probably right" say the others. Where it goes wrong if, other things can also influence those noun 74s. Say if there’s noun 61. ... And that’s when I realized a lot of people were never really on board. Because you go to a meeting and they go, it’s just like you’re reading ??? trails. I don’t necessarily believe your explanation because other things could be effecting it. You know how in any defined problem there is: these are the assumptions I’ve made, this is the framework in which I use to analyze the problem. If my assumptions are violated, then my explanation is no longer necessarily the only explanation. You go back a little to change the assumption: well we’ve got a special cause. A special cause is driving this. Naah -- this is where we have some maths which are the noun 74 differences, we have Knowledge which is our -- other people have studied the universe and we’ve implemented models based on their studies. The ... models which are based on the [name] equations. These are more well established. I’d class that as actual Knowledge. If I class that as Knowledge, I’m using that Knowledge to view the Data that I get from the noun 60. There are some assumptions embodied in that, and I have to be aware of those. If people reject that Knowledge or disagree with the assumptions then it becomes really hard to agree on what’s the interpretation of what’s actually happening.                                                                                                                                                                                                            <break/>  Interviewer: This is a really useful discussion.

So you’ll often have conflicting data. They’re fine by themselves, but when viewed together in my collection of Information, now ???

Given that we have some that don’t have an internal context that we have to discover, we could classify this as the position 58ing problem?

Ultimately, I’m interested in the adjective 78 and distribution of that noun 60. There are a bunch of things which I immediately know are directly relevant. adjective 79 rate, the  Noun 12. ... I can do all of that -- any position 58 should be able to do that. There is something about the nature of the noun 84 that’s probably important. That’s probably going to have to do with: what noun 97es that produce the noun 84? What noun 97es that those raw materials were... It’s not -- I may suspect that they are related. I may not. There was an argument about that. I have to discover that relationship. In a nice case... the number of times when people don’t have any idea about an position 58ing problem. They go "right. Here’s the thing I’m trying to control. We currently have the noun 85 table, there are 500 columns in the noun 85 table, let’s join that with that table and let’s do bivariant plots to every one of them and get the r-squared. And we go through -- I’m not kidding. Ask [name] about Noun 23 and noun 28. This is one of the only -- if the only tool you have is a hammer, everything looks like a thumb. It’s just like that. Can I do anything more sophisticated? Hopefully I can winnow out some of those 500 odd columns, because I know something. I have to be careful, because often -- the thing that’s driving this might be related to this. We don’t measure that. We measure some other things that are related to that. Hopefully I can get a weak relationship between them and the thing of interest. And maybe I’ll discover this thing one day. That’s sort of the noun 97 where we’re trying to work out what drives this. And there are quite a few things we have that where we’ll find a subset of 5 things that can produce a decent linear model but allows us to describe, predict, what that’s going to do. And then time goes by and they don’t work so well anymore which tends to suggest that it was this thing down here that they were related to. And some other things that were also important are changing and we don’t really know what’s going on. That’s actually the key we’re trying to address: what research is trying to do and what the -- technology department solve today’s problems, solve next month’s problems. Research department, solve /the/ problem. Not the same thing. That’s the implication that we’re actually getting to the -- we’re aiming towards laws of nature. What is actually the real reason? As opposed to "How can I get a useful working model that allows us to make more money?" That’s more the technology position 58’s job. Which means we’re going to have overlap and conflict because we have different agendas.                                                                                                                                                                                                            <break/>  Interviewer: You mentioned prediction.                                                                                                                                                                                                            <break/>  Participant: Why do I want to predict?                                                                                                                                                                                                            <break/>  Interviewer: a) why, but b) how do you predict?                                                                                                                                                                                                            <break/>  Participant: If I had a causal model of the factors that control a variable that we’re going to observe, the reason I want to know the noun 74s is that it’s telling me about adjective 78. I want to control the adjective 78. if I know that these center 5 things have positive and negative influences on that adjective 78, and I want adjective 78 to be low, I will try to select those 5 things such that I make it tend to be low. That’s why I want to be able to predict.

Where’s the state of the system? Well, it’s in the current state of the functions. They’re all and the data is immutable, and it’s a different way of thinking about the problem. If we leave it in a nice procedural world where Data resides in either memory or in registers and I carry out operations by moving Data from place to place or combining two pieces to produce another piece of Data. Then I have instructions and I have Data. In a functional architecture -- let’s say LISP. Let’s not talk FORTH. I’ve had limited experience with stack based languages.                                                                                                                                                                                                            <break/>  Interviewer: The real question is: when does stuff in a computer become not-Data? Where does computer based stuff escape the classification of Data?                                                                                                                                                                                                            <break/>  Participant: Well, that’s a meaning we ascribe to it. At the end of the day everything is a stream of bits. So this bit stream is Data. It depends on the level of abstraction you’ve chosen.                                                                                                                                                                                                            <break/>  Interviewer: At what level of abstraction does that change? Is there a point where we get more and more abstract and suddenly those bit streams cease become data.                                                                                                                                                                                                            <break/>  Participant: At a certain point, I’m able to attach meaning to it. When I’m looking at a character on the screen, from the screen’s point of view, some bits came along and it does stuff. And you have an A. Great. I look at those bits whether they’re on or off and say that’s an "a" At that point, I’ve got some Information.                                                                                                                                                                                                            <break/>  Interviewer: So your perception of a character on a screen is not Data, but Information                                                                                                                                                                                                            <break/>  Participant: It can be. If I was looking at DNA sequences, that "a" is just one of the base pairs.

If the person is really powerful it’s no longer about trust. If someone really powerful in an open forum tells me to do something, I ignore that at my peril. It’s about weighing up the Information that’s come to me. Do I have to act on that?

I make the distinction in that case so when we’re discussing the meta-data of those noun 74 tapings, there’s a pipe with X cells and has a hole in each cell. But the pipe... we have one Noun 4 at the end. I’ve told with the other dimensions: you know how many holes there are, you know where they are, you know what the separation is. That’s all informing you about the measurement I’m making at the end of the pipe which is my original piece of Data. So I’ve given you a bunch of Data about the meta-data and you have some Information which is maybe "this isn’t reliable" or maybe its something measuring this thing or the other thing.                                                                                                                                                                                                            <break/>  Interviewer: Is Data atomic?                                                                                                                                                                                                            <break/>  Participant: In this example, we pretend that Data is.

I’m using stuff here so I’m not going to prejudice you in terms of ... what we’re going to be doing is we draw a flow like this, we label the flow with the topic of the flow, and then we label the flow with category of the flow. Whether it’s Data, Information, or Knowledge. And if you say other, we go into depth with what you mean, and what the category implies. And I’ll keep asking you this question until we’re done. There’s no temporal model here, everything just happens at the same time. Because dealing with temporality is just... too much of a pain. We have a flow from you ... What do you send him?                                                                                                                                                                                                                <break/>  Participant: During the experiments, I’ll send him observations from the results.                                                                                                                                                                                                                <break/>  Interviewer: Observations? Or what shall we label this? Results?                                                                                                                                                                                                                <break/>  Participant: I don’t send raw Data. I send interpreted Data. I won’t send raw measurements to him, but I’ll send an interpretation of those raw measurements.                                                                                                                                                                                                                <break/>  Interviewer: Let’s go interpretation of measurements. Is this flow Data, Information, Knowledge, or other?                                                                                                                                                                                                                 <break/>  Participant: What would I call it? I’d be hazy on the difference between Information and Knowledge. Can we define it, or do you have a better definition in your head?                                                                                                                                                                                                                <break/>  Interviewer: Here’s the thing. If there isn’t a difference, then there isn’t a difference. I’m putting the terms out there. You can use them as complete synonyms if you wish. Or you can differentiate them. I’m trying to model what’s in your head. Unfortunately I’ve got difficulty putting probes in.                                                                                                                                                                                                                <break/>  Participant: It’s a black box. I’d probably call it Information then. And I’d call it that because it’s not just raw numbers. I’d plot an interpretation to it by some means. But it’s not Knowledge because it’s the experiment. And it’s a very contrived environment that it’s coming out of, so it’s interpreted Data about this contrived environment. Saying when we do this on the experimental rig, we see this effect happening. And I’ll often leave it fairly plain like that for them because I’m not familiar enough with their day to day observations of the noun 118 to know if this is a relict observation of our experimental rig or if it’s really a phenomenon of the noun 118. It’s not Knowledge yet. We don’t want them to do something at the noun 118 based on that yet.                                                                                                                                                                                                                <break/>  Interviewer: what does the position 127 do with this flow?                                                                                                                                                                                                                <break/>  Participant: What they have done, in the past, considered it. Often it will be verbal or written. They’ll consider it, and then they’ll tell me whether it’s consistent with something they observe on the noun 118.                                                                                                                                                                                                                <break/>  Interviewer: How would we label that flow back to you?                                                                                                                                                                                                                <break/>  Participant: Again, I think it would be Information, because we both realize, me and the noun 118 position 58 realize we’re not talking about the same things. I’ve got a model as a chemical noun 120, and so we’re talking about observations that we’re making and an interpretation of what we’re seeing, and we’re looking to see if there’s a correlation between the two.                                                                                                                                                                                                                <break/>  Interviewer: And so this Information flow back to you. What topic is it? He’s transforming your interpretation of measurements how?                                                                                                                                                                                                                <break/>  Participant: I’ll give a comment about a specific phenomenon that I see. Let’s say it’s a variation with flow rate and time. And I’ll see, under a set of circumstances at a particular point. And that’s what I tell him and he’ll come back and may say: “that’s interesting, but we have situation x,y,z. We see a similar effect.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                <break/>  Interviewer: So we would say that’s correlation with noun 120?                                                                                                                                                                                                                <break/>  Participant: He’ll tell me if my Information correlates or doesn’t.                                                                                                                                                                                                                <break/>  Interviewer: So really, it’s a confirmation of correlation. And you would say that that confirmation of correlation Information because of it interpreted but not situated?                                                                                                                                                                                                                <break/>  Participant: It’s interpreted, but it’s not immediately relevant to the noun 118. We’re not going to change anything. We’re not going to  change what we do at the noun 118 based on that yet. It may change what I do with my experiment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                <break/>  Interviewer: Let’s look at that. He sends back a confirmation of correlation, whether or not it’s positive or negative confirmation, he’s giving you something back. Then, what do you do?                                                                                                                                                                                                                <break/>  Participant: It depends on where the experiments are going, and how critical it is with these experiments. Often I’ll say, “That’s interesting” but I’m going to keep going with my experimental plan because we’re only partway through or it was a side issue that’s not an immediate concern.                                                                                                                                                                                                                <break/>  Interviewer: Is your experiment an entity here?                                                                                                                                                                                                                <break/>  Participant: Yeah, I guess it would. If I dropped dead, I would hope that somebody would keep going with the experiment.

It’s as if the experiment was sending them numbers. Not all like.. but for a time, a season... there’s a fellow position 56 and I’ll need to double-check or get a second opinion or “can you help me with this kind of thing?” and they’ll get the raw numbers and we’ll have it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                <break/>  Interviewer: So the numbers from the experiment go to the position 56s.

Information is an interpretation of those numbers. And Knowledge is an embodiment of something, a real physical operating device of the company. So it’s something that we’re going to write down and keep for posterity and keep using. With the position 56s, ... I’ll stop modeling the Data for a while and just talk about it. It’ll be where... I see something interesting, but I want to make sure that it’s actually a reasonable conclusion. That it’s a sensible thing. That another person in my shoes will also reach. So I’ll do the interpretation of the Data myself, and I’ll also ask them to review it, to have a look at it. And see if it’s a sensible conclusion. So they often would have gotten some raw numbers, but they’ll also get the Information.                                                                                                                                                                                                                <break/>  Interviewer: Is it the same Information that you would be sending to the position 22?

And I’d call that Information. And I’d usually ask them to review the Data, look at the Data, and say do you think that’s reasonable observation? However, if I’ve seen a class of behaviors or a systematic response to the rig to whatever it is I throw at it, then I would say -- then I’m talking to them about Knowledge. And it will be Knowledge about either the rig itself or about some phenomenon we may see on the noun 118.

I can’t... rather than saying, I think I understand the mechanism behind this thing that we’re seeing, and I think that this is the explanation for it, and if that explanation is correct than I can predict the future. If you throw x, y, z, at it it’s going to produce this effect. That’s probably the Information and Knowledge difference.                                                                                                                                                                                                                <break/>  Interviewer: They have three flows going into them.

This is going to get more vague and nebulous as we go on. I’d say it’s just Information. It’s very ... it’s not numbers, it’s not ... although it could be... no, ... this morning, we talked about the case where [someone was] saying something ridiculously beyond the laws of physics. Even a first year undergraduate would recognize that it’s just a loopy kind of thing to say. And how do you correct that kind of thing? It’s more than just Knowledge, the professional support of a positive response to a hypothesis is kind of acknowledgement that things are... that you’re on the right track. So it’s Information there. Because the person has noun 97ed it at least slightly. Ever so little bit. And it hasn’t knocked up any red flags to say that this is stupid. So it’s Information. It’s an immediate interpretation of what’s in there. They haven’t looked at it in detail and found specific problems or errors with it or things like that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                <break/>  Interviewer: Now are there any flows beyond that “Hey, that looks cool.”?                                                                                                                                                                                                                <break/>  Participant: Eventually, I hope that they come back with a technical comment about it, that they’ve thought more deeply about it.

It was convenient for me to be in that role, but it didn’t have to be a position 56 as such.                                                                                                                                                                                                                <break/>  Interviewer: But it was part of this noun 97?                                                                                                                                                                                                                <break/>  Participant: It was part of the project, yes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                <break/>  Interviewer: So what shall we call that role?                                                                                                                                                                                                                <break/>  Participant: Whether the person in the position 56 hat to be that person or not?                                                                                                                                                                                                                <break/>  Interviewer: That’s the beauty of just labeling it as a role. You as the position 56 can send flows to you in that role. We don’t have to instantiate roles really.                                                                                                                                                                                                                <break/>  Participant: I’ll talk around it a bit first to help clean my mind. The person who fulfilled that role needed to be in charge of a small team. Who would take measurements using temporary pieces of equipment on the noun 118. This isn’t using normal noun 118 Noun 4, we actually put extra cameras and extra this and extra that up there to take measurements of what was happening when the noun 118 and bits of equipment were being run for the first couple of times. They weren’t being run with the noun 118 being all operating, So it was slightly contrived. But it’s part of adjective 96 to make sure that everything works properly. that you push button a and things happen as they should.                                                                                                                                                                                                                <break/>  Interviewer: “If we push button A, does pipe A actually flow?”                                                                                                                                                                                                                <break/>  Participant: Does it do the thing we expect it to do? During that there needed to be a bunch of measurements taken so that they could be  analyzed to confirm that the noun 95 intent was being met. So that it could be confirmed to be the noun 95 intent as best as we could tell. And you needed somebody in that role who was familiar with the noun 95 intent and with the equipment that was needed to take those extra measurements.                                                                                                                                                                                                                <break/>  Interviewer: Let’s label this role.                                                                                                                                                                                                                <break/>  Participant: That’s adjective 96 ... are we separating the role from the actual measurements? I would say that’s that way. It’s different from experiments. noun 126s is what they were.                                                                                                                                                                                                                <break/>  Interviewer: These noun 126s, what entity sends them flows?                                                                                                                                                                                                                <break/>  Participant: The main purpose of the noun 126s is to find out that when you press button A that things happen as they should So it was the position 122s, they send to the noun 126s, I guess it was Information.                                                                                                                                                                                                                <break/>  Interviewer: Information about?                                                                                                                                                                                                                <break/>  Participant: Not the noun 126s themselves. They’re not a self-aware entity. So they just receive Data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                <break/>  Interviewer: So here’s the thing.

But I want to transform those numbers in a particular way, If it’s quick like in an excel spreadsheet, if you’re doing a little formula, it could be just some Information.

I usually think of them as an embodiment of Knowledge. There are laws of physics and the laws of chemistry and all of that that we can express as equations, and we can put them in in a generic kind of way then we have this model that has our Knowledge in there. And then we feed it numbers in and numbers will come out and they’ll be transformed according to those laws of physics and the laws of noun 109 in there as well.                                                                                                                                                                                                                <break/>  Interviewer: Physical laws.                                                                                                                                                                                                                <break/>  Participant: Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 <break/>  Interviewer: So you would say that... your transmission to the program of physical laws is a flow of Knowledge? which the program then embodies?                                                                                                                                                                                                                <break/>  Participant: No. I tell it Information.                                                                                                                                                                                                                <break/>  Interviewer: You tell it Information... it then embodies...                                                                                                                                                                                                                <break/>  Participant: I watch it transform, but then that Information is an embodiment of Knowledge. I know what the laws are, but the computer is just a machine. It doesn’t know that... it doesn’t know that the law of gravity is actually useful for saying that things fall down and break. We know that. It gets Information. I won’t even tell the hardware. You’re talking to the software that’s running on top of the hardware. “I want you to do whatever you do to manipulate these numbers in this way.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                <break/>  Interviewer: So you would say that code is Information.                                                                                                                                                                                                                <break/>  Participant: Yes. Based on Knowledge, but it’s just Information.                                                                                                                                                                                                                <break/>  Interviewer: But what you’re sending is not Knowledge, it’s Information.                                                                                                                                                                                                                <break/>  Participant: That’s right.                                                                                                                                                                                                                <break/>  Interviewer: You would say that the ability to make predictive assertions about the universe is a function of?                                                                                                                                                                                                                <break/>  Participant: That’s Knowledge. That’s an understanding of reality. So you need to have consciousness and self-awareness and that kind of thing. So my laptop, I don’t know about yours, but mine definitely doesn’t have self-awareness as far as I can tell.                                                                                                                                                                                                                <break/>  Interviewer: Let’s look at this.

It’s something that you haven’t been able to put a number to, but you think it’s important or that it’s worth noting. It’s some... Information that you want to convey. That’s not the right word. It’s something that you want to convey, a quality about something. And so you’ll try and give it some numbers if you can, but otherwise it’ll be qualitative.                                                                                                                                                                                                                <break/>  Interviewer: Would you say that qualitative Data are Data or Information?

An Eskimo and a Hawaiian are going to have very different ideas of a hot day. So it’s Information. Context is going to be something.

It could be Data, because I might say to the Noun 20 and say “you should increase the Noun 12” why? “because your blast is at 900 degrees.” And  it doesn’t need to be said to them that that’s ridiculously low. That you need to up it to at least 11 preferably 12 hundred degrees. So I could give them a piece of Data and they have enough Knowledge to go, say “Oh yeah. That’s bad.” they know that it’s in error. Or a Knowledge situation is “I think you adjust the angle of this thing by .5 degree.” and at that point I may give Information or Knowledge according to how much Knowledge I think they have or need.

I guess we’re here to ???. ...                                                                                                                                                                                                                    <break/>  ...                                                                                                                                                                                                                    <break/>  Participant: Anyway, you might want to lead me through the noun 97.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    <break/>  Interviewer: Fair enough. ...

View is they articulate a vision. A definition would be they actually write something meaningful.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    <break/>  Interviewer: Tell me what your view of a Noun 1 is, and what you think their views are.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    <break/>  Participant: My view of a Noun 1, it really should be about capturing different sources of Knowledge from different aspects, and that can be from different people, different approaches: You can have production thoughts, research thoughts. Mathematical models. Other motels, like data mining. ... And so you have disparate sources of how things work,                                                                                                                                                                                                                   <break/> and they all relate to making the Noun 2 work better. They think you should do it this way, and the computer model says we should do it this way. They don’t always agree, but they look at it in different perspectives. And they say: "oh the Noun 1 is to grab those Knowledge and we refer to them as knowledge-bases and that’s an extraordinarily old reference. Knowledge-bases together. And then to make a sensible input to provide a single piece of advice to a person. That was my view. A single piece of advice and I’ve implemented the Noun 1 as such. ... we have another person who has a different view on a Noun 1 and he see as much more as a Information system where you provide, as we might refer to: Information to people. And this is commonly, in our field, or philosophy, or where we come from, our research? as well as our [people] in other parts of the business see as Noun 3. So you have a valve that is open or closed, a 1 or 0, as a function of time. We have lots of Noun 4 with calculated outputs and ... A very other common view is to say that they should be provided that information to make their own... A Noun 1 doesn’t tell anyone how to do anything, it just gives them stuff to look at. And maybe it’s just a guided look, maybe you don’t show them this valve, maybe you show them that valve. Nonetheless, it’s about showing them things they want to look at.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    <break/>  Participant: So that’s really the opposing, for me, that’s sort of the two main approaches we talk about taking.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    <break/>  Interviewer: So advice versus providing information. Tell me about advice. What do you mean by advice?                                                                                                                                                                                                                    <break/>  Participant: With advice, I mean a specific action. You actually have to tell someone to do something. Advice is like: "Brian, catch the earlier train." Information to me would be: "Brian, here’s the train schedule. You choose your best train. I’ll just tell you the schedule and then you’ll go on and sort it out for yourself." Where mine is if I want to help you make a decision about what train to catch I’ll gather knowledge from the train master, from people who catch the train and present you: the 1:00 train is the best one for us. In comparison to other people saying "I’ll collate the train timetable information, maybe I’ll have indexes relating to crime levels. So you may then choose, ’I want that train, but it’s got a high crime level, maybe I’ll choose another train. It’s a bit opnoun 71ue, you don’t know how people made the decisions, you’re just giving them information to look at.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    <break/>  Interviewer: When you say knowledge capture, is that what you meant by Noun 4, or is there a different term you mean by...                                                                                                                                                                                                                    <break/>  Participant: In terms of knowledge. Well,it’s funny. I use it in a different way, but it’s probably pretty similar. When we talk about the bubble [DFD people] concepts as inputs, we refer to that -- like a Noun 4 as data as such. And Knowledge would be someone which would be putting that data into context. You might say: "When the valve is above [Noun 12] Celsius, I would turn the valve off" that, to me, is Knowledge, where the value itself is Data. It’s like a hierarchy. Wierdly enough I set my system up in a hierarchial fnoun 137ion. I didn’t want to do it, and  I really love case-based reasoning. Well, we can talk seperately if it comes out of -- the difference between case based reasoning and that form of knowledge compared to other expressions of knowledges, I refer to it as.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    <break/>  Interviewer: Data as Noun 4, Knowledge as the Noun 4 stuff with context with memories, you’d say?

Sometimes you might say: "When a valve is a Noun 12 above [Noun 12] Celsius"                                                                                                                                                                                                                    <break/>  Interviewer: So it’s generalized statements about a Noun 4?                                                                                                                                                                                                                    <break/>  Participant: Yes, that’s right. That has been a reflection of a compromize how we’ve set up the work that they’re doing over the last 5 years.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    <break/>  Interviewer: What about information?

Again, A classic form of Information that I describe it as, it’s multi-dimensional Information. That’s the difference I draw here too. We’re sort of getting into multi-dimensional information as we desribe it. You should talk to [Person X] about this as well. You might have data versus time. It’s two dimensional, it’s a line. And we like making three-dimensional graphs of things so we have this versus that versus that. you can have a peak. We use a mathematical model to generate an optimal point and you talk to [Person X] at the university of [X] about this n-dimensional space which means nothing to me. ...                                                                                                                                                                                                                    <break/>  Participant: Information is really, its like... Data is something you can work with. Information is an expression of the Data in an almost trivial form. It can just be plotting it as a function of time on a graph or contur plot. Something like that. I hold Knowledge as the hierarchy of it all. Where it has that line in context of other things, or people’s experience. It’s where I come from. It’s a personal sense, that it’s a reflection of, that -- I believe in mathematical models. They’re absolutely excellent. but they need to sit alongside experienial knowledge. Mathematical models are, to me, information. Because they take data in and they can transform it into something is maybe trivial or non-trivial, but you might get a predictive Noun 12. And that’s good, but, them, themselves, in my experience, are not actually good on their own. They need knowledge. Someone says: "I only look at that when this happens or that happens. Or it’s no good today because that thing’s broken. We just can’t use it at the moment. But if you looked at it soley in itself. Well, that’s very important. it can or not be, that is people’s experience the Knowledge can help transform the data into information into knowledge.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    <break/>  Interviewer: Is there anything on either side of Data or Knowledge?

As my professonal life, yes it is definitly. As a philosophical perspective, I can appreciate its not. But as far as philosophy in a [company], no its not. Even when we talk to the instrumentation guys, we still talk at that level, we don’t go through it. You can sometimes touch on it. People sometimes allude to it that there’s stuff there.

Maybe we can talk this as some sort of psychological session later.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    <break/>  Interviewer: You’re sending it knowledge...?

I’m sending it computer code. It’s knowledge expressed as computer code, for sure. It actually sends me back Knowledge expressed as textual advice which is often been... ??? over the years.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    <break/>  Interviewer: It sends back knowledge as advice?                                                                                                                                                                                                                    <break/>  Participant: Yeah, as textual advice. I don’t know why I make that distinction., but I’ve always tried to put the stuff it sends back, even to me, because I sit there and read it as textual things that sort of are vaguely sentences I best can do in 32 characters. Its like its text, it’s words it might have a noun and it might have a verb or ...                                                                                                                                                                                                                    <break/>  Interviewer: Is this medium?

Or is it sending text advice through something?                                                                                                                                                                                                                    <break/>  Participant: It’s sending text advice through a range of different mediums. Because you can access it ... we didn’t sort of go there, how people access it, but there is interfaces to how it goes out. And it changes a little bit depending on the interface, but there is sort of one interface which I consider which they really use in the Noun 20. I sort of focus, when I think about it, I think about that. That’s my little box with little words on it. Noun 11 which are bit more discriptive. I’ve actually got a Noun 11 part which has a lot more stuff in it which you can do, no-one ever uses that so it’s almost like it’s ... I don’t really support it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    <break/>  Interviewer: What else do we have?

Data! It sends it data, for sure.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    <break/>  Participant: and that’s expressed as values -- it can be both real values such as a Noun 12 it can also be derived values such as an Noun 13 like that. We sort of draw distinctions a little bit between that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    <break/>  Interviewer: So derived values as in calculation results?                                                                                                                                                                                                                     <break/>  Participant: Yeah. So you might calculate an Noun 13. So Noun 5 calculates some -- an effiency of something. I take that as well as I take raw data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    <break/>  Interviewer: Do we want to say that as a different string?                                                                                                                                                                                                                    <break/>  Participant: Yeah we can.

They have a whole heap of information -- I feel like I’m in front of a barrister, with the terminology. These guys send information back -- these guys have information which they didn’t used to send to Noun 5, but I needed it over here because I was telling them to do something, but they said "well dude, it changed." but I said "I don’t know about it." so I went through a noun 97 with them entering derived data back into the system so I could feed it into my system to feed it back into them... there was definitly a loop there. There used to be a bit of a disconnect, because it was mostly data coming here, data going there. These guys would just spin around themselves....                                                                                                                                                                                                                    <break/>  Participant: Let’s call that Noun 16? they only noun 97 Noun 17, I can give you an example of one.

The Noun 2 doesn’t really calucate anything. It sorta does it sorta doesn’t. As far as I’m concerned it doesn’t. But it has real values, that’s just Noun 4, composition and things like that. And it will send that real values -- it’s wierd, it’s where you sit. Now we’re talking about the philosophy of data, where you sit and things, because -- you’re right, you can pin me down and say well: "Why when it calculates the top down composition that I see that as real value data when it’s not really if you think about it, because it’s a instrument that’s measuring atomic percents and then doing some calculations and reports its as percentage to me. And ovbiously, percentage is not a real value in terms of what that is, but to me, and as you flow through the chain of data, it transforms. It becomes into different forms. Maybe it’s sort of related to the ontology. Well its not really, if you pin me down, maybe it’s not. But it sort of is to me. It’s percentage. Well, it’s not real, but it becomes real. It’s a pinnochio thing. They want to be a real boy. Eventually, after a while, you get these bizzare analogies from me. After a while, once  you pass it around long enough, I guess this happens -- Probably well documented, chinese whisper style, it can become real after a while. And this stuff goes from a non-existant calculated value to something that’s real, measurable, and people love it. You look at its source, and often we have these problems. If you look at the source, the source may not actually maintain the love of over here, but, as you stretch out and try to transform people’s opinion of it changes. It does sort of -- it can be loved, but if you have a look at it, and say no, "that machine broke ten years ago. Why are you still looking at the value?" and they say "Well, we love that. That’s a real value." It’s not doing the right thing, but through transformations and noun 97ing through systems peoples’ experience becomes real when its sort of not.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    <break/>  Interviewer: And by real, you mean, a representation of a real thing?                                                                                                                                                                                                                    <break/>  Participant: That’s right.

Because I’m looking at Noun 5. Noun 5’s feeding me stuff, and I’m feeding that. And those guys are talking to me which is the Noun 14s to Noun 1 developers. But maybe we’re getting ahead of myself. Because we haven’t quite -- this sort of  DFD that we’ve got here with Noun 1 developer, Noun 5, Noun 14, Noun 16, Noun 2 is describing a bit of the -- maybe a different problem that we started off with. Maybe we can label this one as "Noun 2 operation optimization" which is really the purpose of the project and it’s above. And it’s ovbiously different from developing the Noun 1. Ovbiously, we’ll find similar things. Maybe it’s hard to find where to draw the lines.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    <break/>  Interviewer: do we need a line there?                                                                                                                                                                                                                    <break/>  Participant: I’d just take the line out between Noun 5 and Noun 1 for the time being. Depending on the context, I guess. In Noun 2 operation optimization, I’d just..                                                                                                                                                                                                                    <break/>  Interviewer: in that domain, are there any other flows?                                                                                                                                                                                                                    <break/>  Participant: That’s what I’m trying... maybe I can get a photocopy of this and go again? And we have that and we have Noun 5 and the Noun 2 has Noun 5 data and we send it to the guys. And here you have more -- we left out a lot of circles here that we really should fill in. And we’ll just stick to the Noun 2 operation optimization which is different from the Noun 1 noun 129. Maybe this is a more tractable problem. And interesting, and it’s something interesting -- if we can get you in the Noun 20. No promises there. If we can get you over that hurdle? This is sort of like their experience and how I interact with those guys. It would be good to do Noun 1 rule noun 129 because that’s how I interact with the university people which don’t -- I can’t quite -- I can squeese on here. I’m holding my hands above each other. As the layers of information. That’s a column of information which then something may sit above. It’s not two-dimensional as ???. Ovbiously me as the Noun 1 developer is dealing with multiple spaces. Maybe I’m playing it out maybe too two dimensionally.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    <break/>  Participant: So now we’re going to go to. These guys talk to the Noun 9.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    <break/>  Interviewer: these guys being?                                                                                                                                                                                                                    <break/>  Participant: The Noun 14s                                                                                                                                                                                                                    <break/>  Participant: The Noun 14 and Noun 9 often interchange roles. But they see people with vastly different experience. But often when the Noun 9 is away, the Noun 14 has to step into his role in terms of Noun 2 operation. They send each other -- this is really a tough one. They talk to each other. So I’d describe it as they do literally talk to each other. It’s so hard to capture. And I had a go at trying to capture verbal feedback and things like that. These guys, they talk to each other, and they’ll say: "Oh man, the Noun 18’s broken." "Yeah, OK, change this." And my systems blithely -- because they get a phone call "Yeah, something’s going on. Yeah, backed up Noun 19 system" "Okay, yeah, we’re going to make this change." Just lost, it’s out there and thing. People have sorta become accepting of the limitation of this, over here, but it’s really an issue. It’s a really strong data flow I guess that I’m talking to... So they talk to each other.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     <break/>  Interviewer: is this talk: Data, Information, Knowledge or just talk?                                                                                                                                                                                                                    <break/>  Participant: I’d describe it as just ... there are a couple of different levels, but let’s say on an operation optimization ... I’d describe it as Information. But they can actually. But no, no, it’s true. We can put another line in which is really they transmit Knowledge. I can call that experience. And that’s absolutely true. They transmit experience in this direction sort of going out into there and often these guys [Noun 14] are younger guys without a high degree. Maybe they haven’t been to uni. And [Noun 9] will be telling them experience and how to do it while interacting with my system as well. But they don’t quite -- often these are. I don’t know how we can... maybe I can give it [the data flow] an AA. They’re almost duplicate lines, but I’d like to acknowledge them as they’re different. Because there are two people in the Noun 20. There’s the position 8 and the position 9. They’re both looking at my box, but they aren’t seperate people. They deal with things seperately. It would be too trivial to combine these guys together, because they’re different not from my experience. But for your purposes, I’m copying things now, like the Noun 1 provides the same knowledge by text advice to these guys as it does to them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    <break/>  Participant: And similiarly, you know, a lot of these flows where they’re putting set points and getting derived data and calculated data between Noun 5 and the Noun 14 are the same as between Noun 5 and these guys. Similiarly, they sink data into here, and so the Noun 9 sinks data into the Noun 16, the same as the Noun 14. And that’s "real value" and "derived value." Maybe we need to get to the bottom of why that is different.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    <break/>  Interviewer: Why is that different?                                                                                                                                                                                                                    <break/>  Participant: It’s literally, again, it’s a hierarchy thing I think. ...                                                                                                                                                                                                                    <break/>  Interviewer: Position 8 are the boss of...                                                                                                                                                                                                                    <break/>  Participant: I didn’t draw any information back from the Position 9 back to these guys because it doesn’t flow that way. These guys aren’t going to say, ... they might say: "Should I do something?" They won’t change that. While those two guys are in the room together, this is not an absolute rule of course, but organizationally, that guy won’t change -- won’t do Noun 2 operation optimization while that guy’s in the room. He won’t change those set points while he’s there. But if he’s out of the room, then it’s his job to step up to make those changes. This is why I draw. Well, he tells him experience and knowledge, and he talks to him about ... "and so I’m leaving and I’ve got to go somewhere, have a look at that, if it goes up, put a bit of Noun 21 on. sort of stuff." it doesn’t come back the other way. The guy doesn’t sit there and say "ohh, I’m going to make this change without your permission, it doesn’t happen like that. So then, that’s probably why they’re a little bit different. Organizationally, this guy is higher than that guy. He looks after the machines, equipment, primarily. This guy’s after the operation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     <break/>  Interviewer: do any of these systems get Information?

I’m bringing the extra characters that are probably sitting up here, so maybe I could just ... do replicant bloxes so we can just join them up together later as well. So they’ll send them Information as daily targets. And we’ve got the Noun 1 down there. How do these guys interact with here? It’s really wierd to explain. And maybe I think I’m crazy. Now why did I describe that line here ... text advice and knowledge between here... We’ll label that line AA. These guys influence the ability of these guys --                                                                                                                                                                                                                    <break/>  Interviewer: wait, the Noun 1 is getting the AA line?                                                                                                                                                                                                                    <break/>  Participant: It’s just the same line. There is a line in here as well. maybe that’s the best way to describe it. There’s a loop in here which is -- it’s not a direct line ... that’s not true either. That’s definitely true. He sends this -- The Position 22 sends that Knowledge into the Noun 1. He doesn’t send a daily target, that’s going this way.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    <break/>  Interviewer: He doesn’t send that?                                                                                                                                                                                                                    <break/>  Participant: He does send it.

Because, you remember, I’m sending it all the time. It never stops. Like the mail. It keeps coming. He’s his own person as well. But this person reports sort of vaguely to that person, and this person definitely does and [Name] tells these guys -- he influences as a form of Knowledge about what to do with my system. Whether you listen to it or you don’t listen to it. Whether you pay attention to it...                                                                                                                                                                                                                    <break/>  Interviewer: Because there are certain times when you should and certain times when you shouldnt? according to him?                                                                                                                                                                                                                    <break/>  Participant: According to him, yes, that’s right. -- He really is sending them Knowledge. Because it, again, to me is not just about information. that Data/Information/Knowledge hierarchy -- He’s telling people how to use the Noun 1 based on his own experience, based in some sort of context. And there is a group 130 context as well. [Name] doesn’t like that, don’t do that. ... There’s no rational sense in anything. That’s why it’s Knowledge, it’s not Information. Because there’s a context around it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     <break/>  Participant: So that’s the Noun 2 Position 22. So there’s a little loop there. And that’s true, because they won’t send me -- so the Noun 2 Position 22 to the Noun 1 developer. He won’t send me much else apart from the procedure. Because this guy writes a procedure and says "These guys must follow that procedure." And he’s also -- we must acknowledge that he is sending them Knowledge in the form of SOP. That’s the CC line, same line. I just get a copy of it... and I reinterpret it. And even send it back to them. Which is apparently one of the benefits of -- perceived benefits of these systems. Maybe I just -- I haven’t got a good context of a system noun 75 within there. Similiary and functionally, these guys don’t talk to these guys because these guys report to someone else who is the Noun 2 position 25. He doesn’t appear in any of these diagrams. Becuase he’s more of a &lt;grunt&gt; what are you doing? &lt;Grunt&gt; sort of relationship. But similairly, but as the chains get a little bit weaker as they are going up we have ... And here we’re actually progressing wierdly enough, we seem to be progressing through the hierarchy of these organizations. So now, maybe it’s best to describe it as a hierarchy. as the Noun 2Position 22, we’ve got the Noun 2 position 26. We’ve got feeding through... we haven’t quite covered all the boxes, but                                                                                                                                                                                                                    <break/>  Interviewer: we don’t need to,                                                                                                                                                                                                                    <break/>  Participant: I might just... because it’s always about me... Noun 1 developer here.

FF... because Noun 5 also sends FF to the Noun 9...                                                                                                                                                                                                                    <break/>  Participant: That’s right. So these guys send Knowledge to these guys -- the Noun 2 position 26 will send Knowledge to the Noun 2position 22. I’d say actually this is is where I don’t know ... it certainly does influence the Noun 1. Maybe I’m just trying to go back through the chain as I see it. This is just my personal opnion. It would be great to see what they think is different. As it’s getting further away from me, it’s getting more chunked up and not even true anymore. Well, they’ll send the Knowledge back such as like, production conditions and like monthly targets, "We want to make so much Noun 23 month" and these guys will say "we want to make so much Noun 23 per day."

Noun 2 noun 97 condition.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    <break/>  Interviewer: what is that?                                                                                                                                                                                                                    <break/>  Participant: Maybe a health? How healthy is it? Like a person. It’s wierdly enough, because its... because I did say Information, because there must be something special about that. because I percieve this as -- Those guys send those guys Information. They’ll say, we’re going  OK. And may not have that much conxtextualized nature. It may be a graph and they’ll sit there and look at the review at last week’s worth of Information as a time-series graph. They’ll say, "We’re hitting our targets" wierdly enough I didn’t use Knowledge, I used Information. Noun 2 noun 97 conditions like how are we travelling? Here is some graphs which describe. Travelling is a collquoial term of how the Noun 2 is performing. Because if the Noun 2 is not performing well, and the Noun 2 is down here somewhere, it can effect those guys. The production conditions and the monthly target it. Those guys might acknowledge and will here rightly acknowledge problems in production, or in the Noun 2 will affect his monthly target. So it will be the other loop which is getting really hairy for me up to the Noun 23 Making position 41, he’s like "Yearly targets." we’re making X million tons a year. That’s sort of, we’re making X million tons this year. We’ll make that target. ... But I didn’t put the position 41 of Noun 23 making on here, because he does -- This guy sends me as the Noun 1 developer, he really sends me Knowledge in terms of like a philosophy. We have regular meetings with this guy [Name.] We’ll sit down -- we had a showdown meeting just before christmas. And as the Noun 1 developer and him we sit down and he expounds his philosophy on what we should -- I shoudl be doing as the Noun 1 developer. He’s definitly sending me Knowledge about what he thinks should be happening. It is a philosophy saying, "you’re going about this the right way. We want to look at this aspect" of it. To be honest, I don’t send anything back. It’s the hierarchical nature of this ... I just take it like a man. My project got shut down over Christmas. He decided, he expounded the philosophy that we don’t want to do this anymore. He sent me an e-mail one month later, saying "how are you going with the project? Are you completing that work?" I wrote back: "Currently it is not a priority and I will do it when I have time." Dude, man, you told me to stop doing it and then he’s asking me why I’m not doing it? As a hierarchy, he’s there and he’s above me in the organization. He tells me what he wants and I’m there to implement a vision. That actually draws an upper limit boundary for us!                                                                                                                                                                                                                    <break/>  Participant: Wierdly enough, if you’d describe sort of from there to there, to here, we sort of captured that -- the business chain of this? It’s really the business side of things. Now, we haven’t delved into the other side. It really is the operations perspective. Which is a funny one for me to do. In terms of the business , it’s where the money’s at. It’s the important one as far as the business . I wanted to describe it how I developed the Noun 1. Notice I’ve left out the Noun 2 position 27. He hasn’t appeared in here because he’s not part of that business chain in terms of operation optimization. But he’s very important in terms of rule devleopment. Because he’ll have a big influence over how I -- on another section of the diagram which we haven’t filled out which is maybe on, as you look at the page, on the right hand side with Noun 5 at the bottom, there’s a little... He’s over here and there’s a whole other side which we haven’t dealt with which is -- and maybe it’s wierd that I’ve drawn that distinction. That I’ve traveled off one side of this diagram. There’s a whole other side here which we haven’t dealt with  which is Noun 2 position 27 and Position 7 including other position 56s. ...                                                                                                                                                                                                                    <break/>  Interviewer: Before we stop, can you give me three examples (not on here) of your interactions, your data interactions, your Information interactions and your Knowledge interactions with your fellow position 56s? Just a little fluff...                                                                                                                                                                                                                    <break/>  Participant: Data interactions: well I sometimes get tidbits of Information (haha). That I send onto them. I’ll find out about that there’s a spreadsheet somewhere that there’s a spreadsheet full of data that I might choose to share with people. So these guys have. People keep their own little personal records. I’ve been working on a task force about Noun 23 and noun 28, and there’s a whole record about the Noun 23 levels in noun 28, which isn’t recorded in any database, but which some guy with a spreadsheet who works for another company... And he sent it to me and now I’ve got it. And all of us have these little bits and we share it. "Have oyu got any data on that? Yeah I’ve got a little bit of data." that’s the data side of things.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    <break/>  Participant: Information side, We certainly share reports and things like that. It probably comes to presentations and reports and things like that. I often describe them as Information that we’ll share. Someone will say look at the data about the noun 29. "Who will look at the data? Who will write a report?" To me that will contain Information about stuff that I can learn about. Not necessarily Knowledge, because maybe I don’t have the conext.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    <break/>  Participant: And the Knowledge component, I see it with, as my other position 56s, it’s that true sort of sharing of experience and things like that. It won’t happen in reports. It’ll happen in discussions and conversation. Maybe after a presentation, someone will present some information. This is this, this is that. And then we’ll sort of flip into a Knowledge sharing mode -- there will be a bit of back and forth about clairification or context which will help then build your Knowledge. Which you can go away with because Information itself is OK, it doesn’t... it’s for now. But Knowledge, i guess, is something that’s more general. It needs a bit of context. That’s true now, but if I know the context I’ll be able to generalize it for the future, which then will make it Knowledge.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    <break/>  Interviewer: and so you would say a report’s true now?                                                                                                                                                                                                                    <break/>  Participant: Yeah a report’s Information because it’s true now. If you looked at that same report a year later, I don’t necessarily know its true anymore, because conditions might have changed which aren’t documented within that thing. We try to document our assumptions or conditions, but it’s not terribly important to us. Mostly we work like that and we look at it and we say that that was true then. And we go on and say: "is it true now?" Sometimes we don’t even do that. We have a report and "are we going to confirm that’s true? No, we’ll just ignore the report. It’s just Information. It’s not true anymore. we can just dismiss it. And we’re just going to do something now."                                                                                                                                                                                                                     <break/>  Participant: Data would be like values and bits and peices to share with people. Information is like "we can share reports" again derived that often... sometimes...                                                                                                                                                                                                                    <break/>  Interviewer: Time series stuff?                                                                                                                                                                                                                    <break/>  Participant: Yeah. And then the Knowledge part we share would be the conversations, the contextual stuff: "Yeah, you need to think aobut this, and yeah, that was happening at the time" and things like that.</delimited>

I think a good way to segue into the entity diagram is  to tell me what project you think you handle -- that are data-important or that are knowledge important.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        <break/>  Participant: Do you want me to distinguish the two?                                                                                                                                                                                                                        <break/>  Interviewer: Feel free to...                                                                                                                                                                                                                        <break/>  Participant: Clearly data is important -- not clearly. Data is important in a project such as the one that [Name] is working on. Data is also impotant in a project such as [Name] is working on. In both cases I’m not talking about any project I’m involved with. Data is also important in a project that I’m involved with which is related to changing the Noun 30 Noun 21 blend in the noun 60. Now you asked about knowledge, and information, as well?                                                                                                                                                                                                                        <break/>  Participant: Information is important in each of those.

Just to have that simmering in the background. Let’s start with an entity dictionary.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        <break/>  Interviewer: How would you characterize yourself? Here, what we’re looking at is not just you as you, but each of the roles you’re in. So, for example, for me, at the university, one of my roles would be noun 91. student, and that would be separate from teaching assistant. So that’s the kind of roles that I think are best to start with when we’re working on our entity dictionary. ...                                                                                                                                                                                                                        <break/>  Interviewer: We begin by looking at a trivial flow between something and something else in the project you’re participating in.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        <break/>  Participant: The project involves noun 35 with an external organization.

What does the Data, what do the results mean?                                                                                                                                                                                                                        <break/>  Interviewer: And that meaning of results is...

In my books, you analyze data. And generate new Information. New Information can generate a new... So, I have a model in my head, and this is what a noun 46 should be. And that model is Knowledge. That model could be shifted  slightly. A shift in some model (physical or whatever) is due to new Knowledge.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        <break/>  Participant: Within that discussion                                                                                                                                                                                                                        <break/>  Interviewer: we have that iteration. I need to figure out how to represent that iteration. In here we’ve got Knowledge being generated, does it go anywhere?                                                                                                                                                                                                                        <break/>  Participant: For a start, it comes back -- the Knowledge is then transmitted back via information to these guys. We won’t provide that to them. There may be a little bit, but you’re not explicitly... It’s in the form of Information returned to the external organization via an external noun 42                                                                                                                                                                                                                        <break/>  Interviewer: By them analyzing the updated noun 42 they see their own new Information, which means they can generate their own Knowledge?                                                                                                                                                                                                                        <break/>  Participant: No, I don’t think they’d do that necessarily. The distinction here is these are research position 41... they’re an external service provider. If you have a contract for wanting you to do some work on your home for example, a plumber, you won’t necessarily tell them about what it is that you’re going to do with this device, you just tell them I want that fixed, and I want that service provided. and that’s whats happening here. We’re asking them to perform tests and asking them to provide us Data. We’ll assess the data, there’s no interaction with the position 43. They’re just providing that service.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        <break/>  Interviewer: Therefore do you sink your Knowledge somewhere else here so that other people can take it?                                                                                                                                                                                                                        <break/>  Participant: Yes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        <break/>  Interviewer: So let’s name that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        <break/>  Participant: We’ve named these position 39 but we could probably name them more specifically as position 47 because over here because the next offshoot here, the other entity is the position 48.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        <break/>  Interviewer: You, to them, send...                                                                                                                                                                                                                        <break/>  Participant: Information.

I guess I was sort of doing it here, in a way. It’s what you do the Data... What is Data there? Data in itself, if you look at numbers on a sheet of paper, multidimensional, these are numbers in this case. An example using just numbers. Looking at that assemblage of Data points, it’s hard to come up with some mental model. Particularly if it’s multifactorial.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         <break/>  Interviewer: So one of these is a data point?                                                                                                                                                                                                                        <break/>  Participant: All of them are                                                                                                                                                                                                                        <break/>  Interviewer: Each of them is a data point and collectively they are data?                                                                                                                                                                                                                        <break/>  Participant: Yeah. But it’s the interpretation of the data which is required. That can be done by your own mind, but it can be done in a more systematic way: steadfastly, there is tools.

I jumped to that because you were talking about the data points. So that’s just the data points. The constraints are, you’ve got this objective function, there are relationships that define X = Y, help to define that. But then bounding that are constraints. Maybe a way of thinking about it is: if you’re trying to optimize production rates or something like that, you could say OK, production rate = A+BC, but you know that C is bounded by something else, by Data.

You’re anticipating that question, so therefore you generate  a summary of or a distillation of this detailed stuff to present to them to address that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        <break/>  Interviewer: that distillation is?                                                                                                                                                                                                                        <break/>  Participant: Is -- over here we’ve got information.

So you’ve got new Knowledge, which is then put through a filter which is -- its nothing to do with the technical. it’s more about, let’s call it, a social. It’s non-technical. It’s about how to explain to you what I know? So I will try to put it into ... I’ll try to work out what you’re likely to understand, so I’m thinking: “Well, he’s not a social scientist, he’s a IST person, so therefore he’ll understand some noun 109. So I’ll put some maths or a relationship there. But if you were a salesperson with a marketing degree, probably forget about that.” The filter is a verb 112 of -- it’s a device that permits more effective transmission of information between one entity and another.

Maybe there are different flows here that are both Information and Data, and both Information and Knowledge.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        <break/>  Interviewer: Thank you for this time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        <break/>  Participant: It was a pleasure, and I say that sincerely, actually.

Because we’re short on time, I’m going to skip making an entity dictionary. Functionally, an entity is any person or thing or noun 97 that can manipulate Data, Information, and Knowledge in some interesting way. You, yourself, can be multiple entities depending on what your role is. When I’m at university for example, I can have the role of noun 91 researcher, but I can also have the role of Teaching Assistant. And they’re different. My computer doesn’t necessarily have a role. If it’s acting like the pen in my hand, I don’t think about the pen I’m using, I just write. But if I suddenly, go “wait a minute, no, the pen is important because it’s doing some sort of transformation of what I’m doing, then suddenly it’s an entity.” We’ll start with you diagramming a role that you play in this noun 97. And then we’ll go from there to just a trivial flow of Data, Information, or Knowledge, and just build out. What would be a simple role that you play?                                                                                                                                                                                                                            <break/>  Participant: One is, of course, if you count the training, One would be putting together the material.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            <break/>  Interviewer: What could we label that role as?                                                                                                                                                                                                                            <break/>  Participant: I suppose its ... author?

What do I feel is important from a theoretical view? And also what’s important to the noun 60? You have to look at both sides.

We just have them SQL script, and just extract with whatever tools our IST department noun 51. And it could be different programs for different DBs, because in a noun 60, we have sort of a mix of different types of DBs from old to new and depending on system levels too.

Information, I suppose, can mix with all Data, Knowledge. Something that you relate -- it goes from one source to another.

But I suppose someone has some other Knowledge which I could sort of receive too, and then it becomes my Knowledge.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             <break/>  Interviewer: How can someone give you Knowledge?

You can find Knowledge in ... you could get direct Knowledge as sort of verbal, but you can also recieve Data but then you sort of have to compute the Data for it to become Knowledge.

Normally what I do with people is: let’s just go through and figure out what entities there are. What I’m going to do instead is describe to you what an entity could be, and we’ll just jump in because I’d love to get both. An entity is a role that someone or something plays. Tools can be entities if they’re not ready to hand. A pen isn’t an entity because when I’m writing, I don’t go “pen.” But, SAS is probably an entity because I’ll be doing lexical analysis through it. If it’s providing a transformation, it’s an entity. You, yourself, can have multiple entities. As a noun 91 student, I’ve got position 56 hat, I’ve got teaching assistant hat, I’ve got grader hat, I’ve got database position 31 hat. Just because I’m one person doesn’t meant I’m one entity. So, starting with the noun 91.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                <break/>  ...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                <break/>  Interviewer: This is looking at both your noun 91 methodology and the noun 91 noun 97.

Yeah, I’d put that one as Information. That’s responding to what I’ve done and telling me how they think things are going. Whereas guidance is probably more Knowledge, because that’s more pushing me in certain directions or giving me the understanding that I need in order to progress in different directions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                <break/>  Interviewer: What you’re identifying here are normative statements: “You should do this.” I’ll want to unpack those later.

So he knows what’s going on but doesn’t necessarily have a direct hand.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                <break/>  Interviewer: What else do we have?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                <break/>  Participant: I guess you can put other position 56s at [academic institution], but I don’t do much with them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                <break/>  Interviewer: If you don’t do much with them, then they’re not relevant. Two other areas to explore.

I do all my coding in C. Well, yeah, I’ve done a bit of computer programming before but nothing too extensive before this. But so far I’ve learned C, C++, FORTRAN. They’re not too bad, when you don’t know anything better, they’re not too bad. So I’ve done most of my coding in that. I often use one visualization package that I use to look at results or I just put them in excel.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                <break/>  ...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                <break/>  Interviewer: Okay, let’s go with visualization software, and we can lump excel and your other vis stuff in here unless you think we should                                                                                                                                                                                                                                <break/>  Participant: No that’s fine.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                <break/>  Interviewer: do you send different stuff to your visualization software than excel?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                <break/>  Participant: Yes and no. I get the same kind of things back from them. I don’t do an awful lot of transformation stuff. I don’t do a lot of formulas in excel. I just put the numbers in and get graphs.

I’m trying to think of what form that would come under. But say there’s something in the adjective 96 results that’s not quite as you’d expect it, then they can give advice as to what could be causing it, or what to do to test something  else. So you could call it noun 97 Knowledge. The point of the lead position 58 is for them to have more comprehensive understanding of how things work. You can put some other entities in if you want to. “Other Position 22s.” My main flow of communication with them... My background with the project was that I knew how all of the systems worked because I noun 95ed the system. ... I knew how things worked and so I would explain to them how things worked. ... I guess my main flow to them would be noun 97 understanding. Call it Knowledge.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                <break/>  Interviewer: Do they send anything to you?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                <break/>  Participant: They would me adjective 96 results.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                <break/>  Interviewer: The same ones?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                <break/>  Participant: The same Data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                <break/>  Interviewer: How are they different?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                <break/>  Participant: Well, it could be... they do adjective 96 on?? other systems.

That typically has been learned from somewhere else or gained from experience or whatever that enables them a better understanding then they would have otherwise. My understanding of how things would work is that Knowledge is the noun 97 by which Data is turned into Information. So I would say Data is things. It’s numbers, it’s raw Information. It is something that, on its own, doesn’t mean very much. It’s just stuff. Information is an interpretation of that. So it’s kind of something that is understandable to someone without Knowledge, without even concept of what the raw Data is.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                <break/>  Interviewer: So it’s encapsulated something?

A brief discussion on entities. An entitiy is something, someone, that takes in these flows, performs some sort of transformation on them, and outputs flows. Or produces flows, or takes in flows. I would say that, when I was doing tmy masters, I had three roles: I was a student, I was a teaching assistant, and I was the database position 31. For purposes of this diagram, I would be three different entities because not only do they deal with Data, Information, Knowledge, in different ways, but they can talk to each other. Even though it’s me talking to me, it’s me as DBA going: I just wrote this lab me, here are the questions we need to deal with. It’s the DBA talking to the graduate assistant, there are different ways of dealign with stuff. We will ignore things that are ready-at-hand. This pen is not an entitiy because I don’t think about it when I’m writing, I just write. Say I use that computer and I load up SAS, and I load up the 100,000 words of transcript that I’ve written so far. And it munges them and it produces something. SAS is an entitiy becuase it’s taking stuff in and giving me something. It’s noun 97ing it, and I’m aware that it’s noun 97ing it. It’s an eneity to me because it’s not just an invisible flow it’s go there, come back. Scientific instruments can be entities, they can take stuff... What I’m trying to do is be very vague here so I don’t prejudice your philosophy. This is why I’m saying if you think doing an entitiy dictionary is useful we’ll do it. If you’ve got a fairly decent idea, we’ll start trivial and expand out.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    <break/>  Participant: we’ll start trivial?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    <break/>  Interviewer: Let’s start by talking about one of the really beautiful noun 37 cases we just talked about with that semipermiable membrane.

The observations are Knowledge, or are Information.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    <break/>  Participant: Pretty nebulous.

There probably are many. But again, it’s limited to the ones that you talk to. And it’s, for me, trying to “this is the next level down of telling the story” of why, why do these things happen? hang on fellas, that’s not the way it works, this is it. Some of them? [company] ... ??? Interesting story, giving a presentation. This was a few years ago. It was noun 131s. These things are like big bowls. So we’re doing a formal presentation, there’s about half a dozen, a position 106 from here... I start giving this background of noun 131s. And this guy says: “[name], what you’re really saying, independant of type of noun 61, they all form  for the same reason” and I say “spot on.” Did group 130 get that? no. But one of the position 90s picked it up in 5 minutes of me talking. And so, that was a formal feedback to the position 90s, but when I go back, there’s a lot of informal value in the corridor. noun 131s is all about this. Noun 21 noun 132 is all about this. noun 137 is about this. So, for me personally, there is an informal feedback.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    <break/>  Interviewer: So there’s feedback back, whether it’s formal or informal, it takes about the same form?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    <break/>  Participant: Yes.

Every now and then, if it’s the right sort of segment, they will push that in.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    <break/>  Interviewer: So you would say that it’s not so much a flow of Information and Knowledge, as that it comes from you as a Knowledge flow, and then becomes an Information flow they accept. ...

This is the group that sets the operational procedures and standards. This is how you shoot this wheel into that position. You will run this noun 97 at this speed.

Or anything for that matter. If we went to: “What do I do with these noun 37?” First is observation. The second is some sort of chemical analysis. And the third thing, which i’ll come back to is what it looks like at the end of a microscope. And one of the more or less concepts that I push to people is that the story should be independant of scale. In the sense that what I see down the microscope and what I see in the specimen. Or what I see from the scanning electron microscope, they should be a consistent story. When I write the summary those observations should  be independant of scale. They should be what I see. A lot of it is what I see down the microscope has to match in some way, shape, or form, what the SEM is telling me. They tell you different bits of the story, but they must be consistent. They must be the same story. Or compatible with the same story. And, I keep talking about what you see in textures and materials should in some way or form, be explainable between the two. The SEM and the optical microscope. Some people don’t see it that way. “Oh! but this is different.” No, there the same mateirals. How you see them may be slightly different, but the story should be consistent. The next level down. It may not look the same, you’re just seeing different visualizations of the same thing. That’s probably something about the noun 37.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    <break/>  Interviewer: Okay, what it looks like is that physical nature and information isn’t a direct flow. That story tells me that there’s a role that acts as an intermediary between noun 37 and noun 129.

I was just thinking that yes I had been in a situation. Usually the critical thing is: just get me a noun 37. “Oh, oh, we’ve got the noun 37.” But that, in the industrial sense is extremely hard. Usually if you’ve got a bit more control, you want to refine your location. The noun 138 that you’d like to take a noun 37 from. ...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     <break/>  Interviewer: Not just I want a noun 37, but I want a noun 37 from that thing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    <break/>  Participant: The noun 139 there. I want a noun 37 out of thatnoun 140 and I want it pretty soon... And I will go to the pile and pick it out. “Well, that’s different, that’s different.” Because you’re almost doing the analytical stage in your head. “Oh, we’ve got a noun 37.” and the next question is: well wehere was it? I don’t remember. That’s part of it’s: what is its relationship to its other entities? What was its orientation? Is this the top or the bottom? Simple things like that. Usually in giving guidelines for verb 73, it’s “get me a noun 37.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    <break/>  Interviewer: position 141.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    <break/>  Participant: Yes, position 141. And usually you keep it s simple as possible. The best option for me is get me a whole noun 37 and I’ll go over it, and I’ll pick out the noun 37 I really need. And that’s the way I usually work when I can. But if its ??? just get us a noun 37. And with pictures. That’s probably the best thing. Digitial cameras are absolutely terrific. Take a few pictures of where it’s coming from.

Computers, ... servers. And probably another aside to think about over my working life, there’s been a very distinct change in the perception of those sorts of measurements. In the sense of -- when I did my noun 91, measurements were were extremely expensive to do. A noun 74 cell was an extremely expensive piece of gear. They certainly weren’t refined in the Noun 4 precision or accuracy that we have today. And the were extremely expensive. And you noun 95ed your experiments effectively to extract the maximum amount of Information. Maximum reliable Information from experimentation. That’s probably what I’d go on with. That’s part of the Knowledge DB. This is the experience, this ???. Nowdays, because a Noun 4, a DP setting you can get it for a thousand bucks. To wire it into the computer is another thousand. So two grand for a point. Ah, we’ll go for more Data. You see noun 60s instead of 20 years ago, you might have a thousand points in a noun 60, now you might have twenty thousand. Y’know, we’ve got all this Data, but you think “are we doing anything with it?” One of my [old] jobs [somewhere else] was condition monitoring and melting. “When are we actually getting to the refracteries? When are they going to fire?” So they put in a condition monitoring system. My argument was always: “You need to watch this data ??? times ago, it’s your best Data.” “Oh, no, no, we’ve got in a conditioning monitoring system. “ That was the group 130. “And we can measure the Data.” But no one looks at it. To me we have this philosophy, oh we’ll just measure everything and hope that the analysis just trickles out some sort of sense. Whereas I come from an era where you noun 95 the experiment and you have a good idea of how you’re going to extract it. You don’t really much else. It’s planning. You see that, we keep adding more and more noun 97 Noun 4. And you ask the question of [other company], “what are you going to do with this?” “Something.” noun 88:”We might have a look at this thing.” but in the context of the whole operating campaign or at least the last year, you don’t know the reliability of the Information, you don’t see the built in trends, and you’re probably shooting in the dark. But you’ve got the Data points. Three quarters of the Data in the DB, you don’t know how it was [collected]. Just a change in the way businesses perceive things now. But we’ve got this and we’ve got that. But you’ve got to be actively worrying the Data. Pulling out the stories, making sense of it. And it’s a little bit upsetting, but that’s the nature of the game. You’d probably hear much of the same story from [name]. Who: “Oh, we’ll go back and have a look at the D” Uhhh. You’ve got to start sorting it. They’re trying to make the stories out of the Data. Wheras, me, coming here, would probably noun 95 the concept for the system and how we’re going to extract the Data, what we want to do with it, and you start from times of your own. The focus is on getting the position 58ing, and once the position 58ing’s there, we’ll be right. No, no, it doesn’t quite work that way.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    <break/>  ...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     <break/>  Interviewer: The noun 60, Noun 4, and infrastructure send to the noun 97 DB...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    <break/>  Participant: Data.

People do carry interests about the business, probably some of the interest is “can I get my investment out of this?” and some of them, yes, I’ll invest in this business because of etchial reasons. Some of the noun 129 work does filter through. This is from experience, some of this work does filter through into annual reports. It was greatly filtered through, I might add, but it does filter through, and it can happen.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    <break/>  Interviewer: Here’s a question.

They are usually the acess point to a lot of these people. Especially when you get up here. And I’ve found that... my access to [person]... the access to him is through his secretary. Because if you go straight to him, whoosh, into the aether. Gone. No response to any e-mail. But you ring up [name], I need to do this, “right [name], Ok, when do you want to see [name] sometime on this day, this day, or this day?” So there are gatekeepers for the very senior levels of group 130.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    <break/>  Interviewer: Are there line secretaries?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    <break/>  Participant: Not in the [company] organization, not in its current form.

I will explore whether or not my methodologies have demonstrated different conceptions of data and if they are capable of exploring unique realities of data in the first place.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      <break/>  The initial discussion is an examination of my research paradigm and approaches, looking at the philosophical basis of my conclusions. I employ an abductive<link><descriptionsymbol detail='footnote'><m:math><m:mrow><m:mo>*</m:mo></m:mrow></m:math></descriptionsymbol></link> approach to iteratively define universes of interest, rather than applying inductive or deductive approaches.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      <break/>  I am testing two questions of interest, which guide the course of my analysis: whether people have different realities of data and whether my methodologies can discover someone’s personal construction of data. By guiding the abductive research process with these two questions of interest, I may be able to limit my conclusions to the most simple and credible story possible from the evidence.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      <break/>  Using the questions of interest as a guide, I will iterate over the results of a recursive analysis of every interview and survey, looking for evidence of different conceptions of data by looking at their statements about data and the relationships they suggest between data and information and data and knowledge. The evidence suggests that I have successfully answered both questions of interest by demonstrating the existence of three realities of data that emerge from both the surveys and the interviews.

While this shares similarities to the inductive strategy, the approach looks more to suggest boundaries to a region of possible answers and less towards finding (inducing) the governing rule of all the data collected. It is the approach used when there is insufficient evidence to even start guessing [<link destination='1:Dubois2002' location='1:Dubois2002'>56</link> and <link destination='1:Levin-Rozalis2008'

interview description will be written in strong language with categorical statements about the nature of data, information, and knowledge. These are my observations and interpretations from what the participants stated as refined through recursive analysis, not my own philosophies. Further testing is required before these statements can be codified into any kind of statement covering many people’s constructions of data. As one of the end products  of my methodologies is a person-specific understanding for the interviewer to the participant, I feel that these analyses will capture that specific understanding and already provide a useful tool for any designers of databases or interfaces who want to use my methodologies.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   <section detail='subsection' location='aut:182'>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   <sectionnumber>8.3.1</sectionnumber>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     <sectiontitle>Data as Communications</sectiontitle>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     <sectioncontent> One of the three constructions of data is that data are encoded signs. Signs that exist on paper or electronically are passed between humans who may then interpret those signs as data for information or knowledge encoded into them. In this construction, data is a technological artifact rather than something generated and manipulated by humans. Information and knowledge are passed using data, but are not of the same fundamental nature. The relationship is a container metaphor rather than hierarchical.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      <break/>  The few interviews expounding upon this construction suggest that significant research is necessary to explore its tenets. Beyond that, there is some evidence that this construction may be held as a secondary way of understanding data when dealing with technological systems<link><descriptionsymbol detail='footnote'><m:math><m:mrow><m:mo>*</m:mo></m:mrow></m:math></descriptionsymbol></link> rather than as a fully-fledged construction of data of its own.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       <section detail='subsubsection' reference='Interview I' location='aut:184'>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       <sectionnumber>8.3.1.1</sectionnumber>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         <sectiontitle>Interview I</sectiontitle>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         <sectioncontent>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         <float detail='marginfigure'>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           <floatcontent>Technical pilot interview, exploring a Facebook game.

In this interview, the participant and I explored the leadership dynamics of a Facebook Game. More details about the SDFN diagram and its analysis can be found in chapter 3, in the case  study. This first interview will offer the raw quotes, as well as the recursive analysis appropriate to the section in which the quote appears, thanks to explicit permission by participant.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          <break/>  Data, information, and knowledge relate to each other. Data is a menial category between these three. Data exists only as itself, without reliance on anything else. <delimited detail='quotation'>“Anything else”</delimited>  here means external signs which frame, or contextualize, data as well as indications that the data requires judgment or discernment on the part of the recipient. I believe that the participant considers the application of context to be something required of ambiguity or importance, and therefore of increased importance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          <break/>  Data is not a function of expertise or knowledge.

It’s a sort of consensus-building. That’s where it’s knowledge, because by sharing that knowledge you can build a common consensus which we can work around. Because if we don’t share each other’s opinions or experiences then we never build the consensus to actually operate, otherwise you’d just be individuals because it, generally as a clan, we have to come up with a consensual view of everything..                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            <break/>  Interviewer: Do we want to have consensus as another line?

Data is interesting only in the sense that it represents the mental activity of the communicator, not as any kind of thing on which to take action. The  differentiation only extends to the comment that something is <delimited detail='quotation'>“sort of data”</delimited>  potentially representing an internal cognitive dissonance between the two ideas. <delimited detail='extract'>Participant: It’s when you’re talking to another person and they’re passing their knowledge of what happened to them and what happened in the past to you.

Experiential Knowledge is what you get from doing things. You learn from criticism, experimentation, failure. A different kind of knowledge is someone else’s experience. Knowledge is privileged over data. Represents <delimited detail='quotation'>“knowing”</delimited> over "observation.</delimited> There was no discussion on transformations of data. Moreover, no conclusions can be drawn from inference, as it is equally likely that no transformative framework exists such that the standard hierarchy is present. Each term seemed to be discussed on its own merits without reference to the others. There are two constructions of data found here: data as a menial-interpersonal communication and data as a menial-technical communication. In both senses, data contains no privilege over information or knowledge. As menial-technical, data seems to be considered to be bits or human instructions rendered as bits: self-encapsulating orders for action. As menial-interpersonal, data seems to  be expressed observations of the world without a knowledge basis: empty words to be corrected and brought in line with the consensus formed by more experienced people.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           <section detail='subsubsection' location='aut:185'>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           <sectionnumber>8.3.1.2</sectionnumber>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             <sectiontitle>Interview II</sectiontitle>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             <sectioncontent>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             <float detail='marginfigure'>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               <floatcontent>The participant is an information worker.

The universal application of data-as-container and information as root-of-meaning suggests that this construction extends beyond a simple communicative reality that can be used in conjunction with other constructions. Rather, it strictly defines a role for data in the storage of signs and relegates it to a strictly supportive role with respect to meaning.

While most of the other interviews focused on more technical topics, the communicative/business focus of this discussion provided an interesting counterpoint to the other interviews featured in the rest of this analysis. Observation is the fundamental component of data, allowing interpreted data to be useful information. Information becomes knowledge, with the hierarchy continuing beyond knowledge: <delimited detail='extract'>Knowledge is probably not the top of the hierarchy. Universal truths, e.g. things called <delimited detail='quotation'>“Laws”</delimited> in science, could be called wisdom (W).</delimited> In the interview, the participant began with a discussion of their opinion of the relationships between data, information, and knowledge. Later in the interview, however, they admitted to a change of their preconceptions due to the interview: <delimited detail='quotation'>“I consider [data and information] to be a hierarchy, but it’s not very clear in my mind”</delimited>  is a comment made by participant at the start of the interview. Later in the interview, the participant observed that participation in the <synonym detail='abbreviation' tag='SDFN'>SDFN</synonym> produced a change of understanding of data: <delimited detail='extract'>Coming into this interview, I thought that the hierarchy was Data, Information, Knowledge with maybe Wisdom or something above that. Or something crazy like that. Way out there. During the meeting, I think I... with your... non-directional coaching, you helped me to see where things were probably Data, where those Data were used by others to form Information. And then, pieces of Information, there’s something higher above information.</delimited> Structured and organized data, as delivered for a persuasive argument, becomes in  formation. Data can be transformed into knowledge directly, such as a scientist predicting movement with Newton’s first law of motion. In a prediction of the future as information, the predictor has to take data (observations of something happening), and input them into knowledge (a scientific model). Interestingly, data also encodes information and knowledge as well as forming the basis of those two concepts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      <break/>  Knowledge is the theoretical basis of understanding-of-the-world. Two people discussing a simple mechanical operation are communicating information, but the theory driving that discussion is knowledge. Furthermore, the jargon used in that discussion also represents knowledge, whereas a generalized description is <delimited detail='quotation'>“somewhere between data and information.”</delimited>  Thus, an understanding of the state of the art and the status quo is knowledge of what is possible or effective to do. Operation of effective management practices is also knowledge, despite the management theories themselves not being transmitted. Because the knowledge of effective management inspired the communications to modify behavior, the communications themselves are knowledge, representing the practice of those theories.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      <break/>  Information is data structured for a purpose.

There is a cyclic hierarchy of data as observations, localized by information, and filtered by knowledge, becoming information and knowledge. Knowledge then directs the gathering of the next cycle of information. There are no obvious demographic characteristics to explain the strong subjective nature of this participant’s views, though they seemed to engage more strongly with databases than did those of some of the other participants.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          <break/>  Data is used both in singular and plural senses, data can have qualities, and measurement generates a data point. Data relates to information and knowledge in a cyclic  hierarchy<link><descriptionsymbol detail='footnote'><m:math><m:mrow><m:mo>*</m:mo></m:mrow></m:math></descriptionsymbol></link> , such that some assertions about the world (knowledge) form a context within which to view data. <delimited detail='quotation'>“Knowledge filters data, which produces information, which produces knowledge. The acceptance of new knowledge is predicated on extant filters.”</delimited> One example of context modulating the nature of data is the understanding of a sensor’s purpose changing the observer’s interpretation of the data produced by that sensor. In this understanding, background education is a primary contributor to a piece of data’s context.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          <break/>  Information’s localization of data from the <delimited detail='quotation'>“study of the issue at hand”</delimited>  helps the recipient to understand what the data means. Information emerges from a contextualization of data: <delimited detail='quotation'>“In order to have context [within] which to understand data, background education (knowledge) and the study of the problem at hand (information) must be combined.”</delimited>  Knowledge and information represent different levels of understanding, with knowledge formed by integrated conclusions versus the ordered and contextualized data of information.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          <break/>  Understanding in this case is an awareness of applicability. All data, information, and knowledge interact with mental models of the worlds. Locally true items are information, whereas knowledge informs models that are more global. Because the generation of knowledge is a function of incoming filtered data, we sometimes get conflicts in explanations: <delimited detail='extract'>Explanation is contextualizing [models] for specific circumstances. Explanations should expand knowledge.

This set of localized data is contextualized, which increases relevance at the same time that it increases potential error or subjectivity. Despite claims of concrete data, data in this construction must be subjective: it is filtered from human observations. However, the self-reflection of that subjectivity creates meta-data about reliability and thereby filters for useful data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          <break/>  Data is a discrete observation.

Data is treated as if it is atomic, despite the ability to perform different, closer observations of the same thing. The presence of the term <delimited detail='quotation'>“filter,”</delimited>  one of the most important keywords that I found, suggests that data as observation is produced from any observation of the world and is thus a subjective construction, tied to the observer, rather than evidence of the world.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          <break/>  Meaning is produced through the negative feedback of knowledge.

Normally glyphs become information, but when they’re just representations of data (like the ’A’ signifying a part of the base pair in DNA) they’re still data.”</delimited>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           <section detail='subsection' location='aut:190'>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           <sectionnumber>8.3.3</sectionnumber>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             <sectiontitle>Data as Facts</sectiontitle>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             <sectioncontent> Conceptions of data in this category tend to be more scientifically oriented, representing data as only the results of careful consideration and measurement.

Although there are elements of contextualization here, the view of data as records of measurements indicates a different construction of data when compared to the other information specialists<link><descriptionsymbol detail='footnote'><m:math><m:mrow><m:mi>†</m:mi></m:mrow></m:math></descriptionsymbol></link> . More research is necessary to explore how interactions with technical devices shape conceptions of data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      <break/>  There is a strong relationship between information and knowledge: <delimited detail='extract'>An example of information is a time series trend.

Mathematical models are information, which complement experiential knowledge. However, models are useless without data as input. Information-as-model requires contextualization (knowledge) by a person to be useful: <delimited detail='quotation'>“People’s experience, as knowledge, tells them when to transform data into information into knowledge.”</delimited>  Thus, data is treated as if it is atomic, despite being decomposable in other contexts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      <break/>  Looking at the higher levels of the hierarchy, knowledge must be explicit and encodable (such as into source code), but it has fewer restrictions than information because information is less discrete. Data are components of information. People treat <delimited detail='quotation'>“derived data”</delimited>  as <delimited detail='quotation'>“real”</delimited>  despite knowledge that it has been processed. In the local jargon of the research environment, real seems to mean <delimited detail='quotation'>“authentic and an atomic representation of a measurement.”</delimited> Data are measured facts. They can be input to mathematical models, contextualized with information, and generalized with knowledge. They are created from sensors and bits. This construction clearly articulates Ackoff’s hierarchy of data, information, and knowledge, viewing data as unimportant building blocks in the path towards gener  alizable statements.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       <section detail='subsubsection' location='aut:195'>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       <sectionnumber>8.3.3.3</sectionnumber>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         <sectiontitle>Interview VII</sectiontitle>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         <sectioncontent>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         <float detail='marginfigure'>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           <floatcontent>The participant is a scientist.

Those results, interpreted and packaged, are data. Although the participant uses the container metaphor here, information is not acting as a passive sign-repository. Rather, the contextualization of information is explicitly differentiated from the pure numbers of data, rather than data being transformed into information.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          <break/>  Data, analyzed into information, may create novel information.

At the base of the hierarchy, however, rests data as facts measured into numbers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           <section detail='subsubsection' location='aut:197'>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           <sectionnumber>8.3.3.4</sectionnumber>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             <sectiontitle>Interview VIII</sectiontitle>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             <sectioncontent>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             <float detail='marginfigure'>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               <floatcontent>The participant is a researcher from a different company.

The interview was taken spontaneously while they were visiting the site on one of the days I conducted interviews. Data are rendered measurements. Unlike Interview VII, the measurements are not constrained to purely numerical entities, but require the same level of objective rigidity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              <break/>  In the interview, the participant did not discuss any hierarchy of data, information, or knowledge. While there seem to be strong verbal differences between data and the others, there are no transformations from data into information or knowledge. Information is understood quite differently from data or knowledge: <delimited detail='quotation'>“Information is a container for data and knowledge.”</delimited> Knowledge is transmittable experience: <delimited detail='quotation'>“Knowledge is perception of something, what you think you know.”</delimited>  Experience manifests as intuitions and requests for specific data are an expression of encoded knowledge. In one example, the participant transmits a request for an image to the database: <delimited detail='quotation'>“I would be sending that knowledge, even if the DB doesn’t acknowledge it.”</delimited>  Knowledge is transmitted in the act of using knowledge, despite the receiving components possibly not being able to understand that what they are receiving is indeed knowledge.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              <break/>  Specific data retrieval is a function of knowledge. Because knowledge is present in the act of using knowledge, data requests to computing devices are formed from knowledge and therefore represent the sender’s knowledge, rather than the recipient’s received data. This represents an interesting meta-component of this conception of data, representing an explicit trading zone formed between entities sharing what one of them considers to be data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              <break/>  Information is a container. Bits are information and form the substance of the container. Beyond the container metaphor is also a question of quality: <delimited detail='extract'>Information is a quality. It mixes with data and knowledge. Something that you relate, it goes from one source to another. Any kind of data or knowledge is some kind of information.</delimited> Thus, information is more than a simple container, and may seem to be an intrinsic building block of data-knowledge interaction with the world. Information seems to equate to semiotic ideas, as it can be a representation or transmission agent. In strong contrast to the constructions of the data-as-communication camp, information is communication. Information, being formed of signs, requires interpretation for the extraction of the data and knowledge components of use to computers and humans, respectively.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              <break/>  Data are factual representations of measurements. They usually form numbers, but, <delimited detail='quotation'>“Information is text and data is numbers, but even text could be data. Text as data  are descriptions of measurements.”</delimited>  The fundamental characteristic of data is that it is the factual product of experiment. At the same time, the participant also seems to use data-as-technical, because they describe punching in a few numbers to get a drawing as data as well.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              <break/>  This interview represents a fascinating departure from the normal affordances expressed as it provides a strong definition of data and knowledge and a very weak, subsidiary, and technical view of information. One possible explanation is that, coming from another country’s cultural understandings, participant linked the term information to the computerized bits and had less experience with other uses of information. This interview, alone, suggests a strong need for an international investigation into the different cultural conceptions of data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               <section detail='subsubsection' location='aut:198'>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               <sectionnumber>8.3.3.5</sectionnumber>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 <sectiontitle>Interview IX</sectiontitle>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 <sectioncontent>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 <float detail='marginfigure'>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   <floatcontent>The participant is an engineer.

In both frames of thought, participant describes data as something inherently numeric, with some basis in fact.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  <break/>  Data, information, and knowledge relate in a cyclic hierarchy. Data interpreted via existing knowledge creates information. Information analyzed creates knowledge. There is a container metaphor in this construction of data as, <delimited detail='quotation'>“Information can appear alongside knowledge or as a component of knowledge.”</delimited>  As a practical example of this understanding: equipment returns data that is processed into information via an engineer. Analysis is then performed as to <delimited detail='quotation'>“whether things are working.”</delimited>  Information is produced  by an analysis of data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  <break/>  Knowledge is fundamentally experiential: <delimited detail='quotation'>“I would define knowledge as something that an individual or entity... something that an entity possesses. That typically has been learned from somewhere else or gained from experience or whatever that enables them a better understanding then they would have otherwise.”</delimited>  Knowledge as understanding represents knowledge as model, articulating the nature of the universe by making predictions about future events.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  <break/>  Knowledge acts as the agent that transforms data into information: <delimited detail='extract'>My understanding of how things would work is that knowledge is the process by which data is turned into information. So I would say data is things. It is numbers, it is raw information. It is something that, on its own, doesn’t mean very much. It’s just stuff. Information is an interpretation of that. So it’s kind of something that is understandable to someone without knowledge, without even concept of what the raw data is.</delimited> Knowledge is understanding: advice about the causes of unexpected events. Knowledge can be communicated and the creation of understanding of the process under investigation is knowledge. Documentation contains knowledge because it presents a history of actions, and can provide methods for analyzing data. The analyzed data, in some ways the <delimited detail='quotation'>“understood data,”</delimited>  is collected in things like reports. The report, however, just contains facts about what was done and the results. <delimited detail='quotation'>“[Less meaningful] stuff is the information and the results are data.”</delimited> Data are numbers: <delimited detail='quotation'>“You can put them in a list. There is a defined quantity. They can be grouped, they can be ordered or whatever. They probably are data. You can put them in a spreadsheet.”</delimited>  However, the emphasis seems to be on numbers rather than on scientific results: not on the objectivity but on the coding mechanism. The participant believes that code is data: source code is instructions and numbers to work with.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  <break/>  Information is connected with the communicative act. Facts are transmitted via  information, but there does not seem to be any evidence to indicate that facts are information, merely that information is the semiotic encoding [<link destination='1:Sperber1995' location='1:Sperber1995'>58</link> ] process by which they are communicated. Knowledge can be communicated through information. The recipient, in possession of this encoded knowledge, must then analyze the information to retrieve its knowledge component.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  <break/>  In some ways, information described in this construction echoes the information as container construction of Interview VIII. While there is evidence of the participant’s cyclic hierarchy, there are interesting ambiguities relating to the relationship of information, <delimited detail='quotation'>“raw information”</delimited> , and facts. While data are encoded pre-facts expressed as numbers, this interview presents difficulties in classification and represents an edge case worthy of future research.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   <section detail='subsubsection' location='aut:200'>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   <sectionnumber>8.3.3.6</sectionnumber>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     <sectiontitle>Interview X</sectiontitle>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     <sectioncontent>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     <float detail='marginfigure'>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       <floatcontent>The participant is a researcher external to the company.

Their conception of data represents something with a strong sense of embodiment; data is physically present in the world, in relations between matter. Measurements and observations can discover data, but not create it out of subjective whole cloth.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      <break/>  One of the more interesting concepts of the interview was that of formality. The idea of formality is raising a McLuhan-like <delimited detail='quotation'>“medium is the message”</delimited>  level of meta-analysis. It notes that the context of a communication and its source within an organization contribute significantly to the actions one takes upon it, despite the same communication being passed from different directions: <delimited detail='quotation'>“Information passed from knowledge won’t be turned into knowledge by the recipient due to a lack of formal power within the  organization. The information is just <delimited detail='quote'>‘the background why’</delimited> that doesn’t change actions.”</delimited> Formality, the coding of the <delimited detail='quotation'>“authority”</delimited>  encoded in the message’s medium, is something that modulates knowledge rather than a unique category to itself. Formality represents an actionable instance of whatever the category is. Written reports, delivered to responsible people in the organization, are an example of formal knowledge. They are incorporated into the organization’s stock of knowledge and acted upon. Those same reports delivered to interested parties, informally, do not have the same actionable qualities.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      <break/>  Formal knowledge is an expression and transference of technical understanding. Components of the flow described by the participant include distilled and certified data sets, the analysis of those sets, and other supporting observational material. The certification of the data sets is to insure that the analysis is internally consistent. Certification is checking the fit of <delimited detail='quotation'>“internal guidelines of quality.”</delimited>  To designate something as certified is to express an opinion of its reliability and repeatability. Because of the additional process of certification, formal x can be acted upon. The participant believes that normal flows, lacking confirmation, are not processed in the same way.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      <break/>  There is clear evidence for a reverse hierarchy in the interview. The Tuomi hierarchy suggests that we use knowledge to build information that allows us to extract data from the world; this data then allows us to update our models of the world. In this way, as information frames our requests for data (subjective or objective as they may be) it is possible to check the integrity of the data and contextualize it by inspecting the originating information. Experiments can be designed to extract information from sensors and computing devices operating on machinery. When sensors are rare, experiments are designed to maximize <delimited detail='quotation'>“reliable information from an experiment.”</delimited> Knowledge is expertise. Expertise, however, is expressed as an understanding of  the world that shapes action. The participant observes that <delimited detail='quotation'>“corridor conversations”</delimited> discussed in an informal setting can contain information and knowledge. Information, in this case, <delimited detail='quotation'>“is the things that I can reduce to something technical.”</delimited>  Knowledge <delimited detail='quotation'>“is their understanding of the process, how and why they turn levers and their perception of the basis of that.”</delimited>  Thus, as expertise accumulates from the past shared precedents of actions, events, and training, it acts as a guide to action. It informs information-gathering methodologies, which then inform data-collection strategies. The use of <delimited detail='quotation'>“reduce”</delimited>  in the quote above is better understood as <delimited detail='quotation'>“abstraction”</delimited>  rather than implying that information is <delimited detail='quotation'>“under”</delimited>  knowledge.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      <break/>  Information has a temporal element or has a different level of reliability. Whereas more sensors, both cheaper and more connected, produce more data, the output of multiple sensors over time produces information. <delimited detail='quotation'>“In the context of the whole operating campaign, you don’t know the reliability of the information, you don’t see the built in trends... but you’ve got the data points. Three quarters of the data in the database, you don’t know how it was acquired.”</delimited>  Although information may appear to be used synonymously with data, there is a suggestion that a thing can be classified as data or information based on some kind of underlying or meta-characteristic.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      <break/>  For example, a physical sample can embody both data and information, depending to whom it is sent. This suggests that observations and numbers are latent in the world. In this way, observation transforms latent information or data in the atomic or molecular structure of the thing being experimented upon into more easily recognizable numbers with defined error limits. This transformation is not an external imposition of measurement, but a recognition of something that is already there.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      <break/>  Information is an observation of the world. Observations of physical nature are information assigned from parameters informed by knowledge as previous experience.  The participant strongly believes in the objectivity of information. They require that different types of measurements of the same object correspond. In this instance, a sample represents embodied information. There is no inherent knowledge of what it is in the object, but it is information. If the information is analyzed, it then can become data. In this vein, environmental observations surrounding the sample are information, creating a <delimited detail='quotation'>“picture of the problem.”</delimited>  Binary signals from switches can be information or data, depending on whether they represent state status (information) or measurements of quantities and masses.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      <break/>  The apex of the hierarchy is data. Data are contextualized hard numbers. Data can be generated from <delimited detail='quotation'>“something you can reduce to a number. It has observations, but it’s reducible to a number.”</delimited>  Optimally, samples will be accompanied by recorded site observations, situating the sample in some sort of context.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      <break/>  Unlike the other interviews, this one holds no indication that contextualization serves to transform the data into information. Instead, contextualization creates data that are more valuable. All things contain within them latent information that, through the correct experiments, may be observable. Only through analysis can the observed and recorded results be promoted to data. One method of analysis is a chemical analysis because the results of chemical analysis are deemed <delimited detail='quotation'>“real”</delimited>  and <delimited detail='quotation'>“hard data”</delimited>  numbers according to standards.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      <break/>  At the same time, data has different natures according to the roles that need the data. <delimited detail='quotation'>“The geologist says I want the sample.

Furthermore, dud  data-data that is erroneous-is possible and is a likely result of cost-saving measures.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       <section detail='subsection' location='aut:201'>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       <sectionnumber>8.3.4</sectionnumber>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         <sectiontitle>Reflection Conclusion</sectiontitle>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         <sectioncontent> My findings fundamentally agree with and extend both Chaim Zins’ work and the definitions of the Oxford English Dictionary.

This section documents the results of my second survey attempt and is a check on the  conclusions drawn from my interviews. Many different participants participated in this survey, being drawn from academics, <synonym detail='abbreviation' tag='IST'>IST</synonym> professionals, other workers at BlueScope, and intelligence workers from the United States civilian and military intelligence establishments.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              <break/>  Survey analysis proceeds in a roughly straightforward fashion. I discuss interesting aspects of each incoming survey, and try to derive their conception of data by looking at how they classify data, information, and knowledge. Their classifications and the relationships they articulate between them may give some clue about each participant’s conceptions of data. Less time will be spent on each individual survey due to their less comprehensive nature. The terms <delimited detail='quotation'>“participant”</delimited> and the singular <delimited detail='quotation'>“they”</delimited> will continue to be used to indicate the survey-taker.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              <break/>  These surveys were the first deployment of my survey methodology that resulted in any kind of success. As such, the instructions were not close to perfect, with a few survey- takers misunderstanding the instructions. I state this with certainty as one participant (name withheld, but permission given) had the following to say in an e-mail: <delimited detail='extract'>Also, I had a hard time with the questions. About midway through the survey, I realized that some of the questions were looking for a semantic understanding of the meaning of the highlighted words. I began the survey looking at it through an analyst’s eyes, with the understanding that data coming in only becomes information or knowledge if it reveals something about the intended target -- usually a person or group of people (network). As I went along, I realized that you were differentiating between data, information, and knowledge as semantic definitions that all described different types of incoming <delimited detail='quotation'>“media”</delimited> or <delimited detail='quotation'>“communications”</delimited>. I got the impression that you viewed data as something measurable, information as something that feeds understanding, and knowledge as something that is either factual or knowable. Since these are pretty disparate understandings of the terminology, it was difficult to reconcile my answers between the two methods of differentiating the data types.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                <break/>  I offer this as perhaps an anecdotal story about the problems with this kind of question. Like so many issues surrounding understanding within a community (e.g., religious doctrine), the real question here is perhaps not so much a matter of different perceptions within  a subculture, but whether or not the subculture has taken the time to clearly define their terminology to enable effective communication. For more <delimited detail='quotation'>“tangible”</delimited> elements of conversation, like computer design, engineering, or medicine, the subcultures tend to build a sophisticated lexicon of industry jargon very quickly, because the objects described (whether processes, methods, tools, concepts, or physical things) are easy to understand. With subcultures that focus on more ambiguous topics (freedom, truth, spirituality, goodness, guilt, culpability), the clarity of their jargon becomes diluted by variation in understanding of the meanings of the subculture’s terminology. You (purposely?) do not define what information, data, and knowledge mean in your survey. Therefore, these terms will carry a wide variety of denotations and connotations with them. The implication is that effective communication within the intelligence subculture cannot begin until the subculture’s definition of these terms is made explicit.</delimited>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           <break/> Therefore, the products of this analysis should be taken with a grain of salt, and used to suggest that far more work can be done in this area, as opposed to presenting any kind of definitive or reproducible look at the reality of data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              <break/>  As stated in the methodology<link><descriptionsymbol detail='footnote'><m:math><m:mrow><m:mo>*</m:mo></m:mrow></m:math></descriptionsymbol></link>, the surveys allowed participants to self-identify by role and then classify a series of scenarios<link><descriptionsymbol detail='footnote'><m:math><m:mrow><m:mi>†</m:mi></m:mrow></m:math></descriptionsymbol></link> as to being data, information, knowledge, or other. The self-identification of role will be communicated in summarized form in each survey below. The summary will be generalized to preserve confidentiality. From each survey, I will abstract the most interesting explanations given of categorization. Included in each summary will also be a description of the general proportions of the answers. Each participant not only has their own conception of data, but their own rationale for identifying things as Data, Information, Knowledge, or Other. The analysis will also briefly touch on the nature of each participant’s categorizations of the Other, and how they may influence their construction of data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              <break/>  Each introductory paragraph will contain a count, as noted, of X data, Y information, and Z knowledge.

In addition, the number of surveys is not sufficiently high for any statistically useful generalizations. As ever, this research is just laying the foundation for more intensive research, and I feel that this survey structure could form the basis for an excellent long-term study of many people’s conceptions of data and how they change over time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               <section detail='subsection' reference='Survey I' location='aut:205'>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               <sectionnumber>8.4.1</sectionnumber>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 <sectiontitle>Survey I</sectiontitle>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 <sectioncontent> The participant is working in the database labs of a university.

One explanation of the unusual sense of symbol without meaning is that the participant’s role is sharply different when compared to the other interviews. Furthermore, when considered in light of databases, a purely technical understanding of data could support the symbol-without-meaning interpretation if the participant does not assign computers the ability to manipulate meaning.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   <break/>  Information is classified as <delimited detail='quotation'>“anything with meaning”</delimited>:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  <itemgroup detail='itemize'>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   <item>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     <itemtag><m:math><m:mrow><m:mo>•</m:mo></m:mrow></m:math></itemtag>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     <itemcontent><delimited detail='quotation'>“Information, since data doesn’t necessarily have a meaning and knowledge is factual/practical information.

However, if we explore the meaning beyond analyzed data, defining the term becomes quite tricky. It is easy to exclude knowledge as actionable information, but the very specificity of the term <delimited detail='quotation'>“analyzed data”</delimited> precludes most understanding. In some ways, the meaning of information could be as broad as information as statements about nouns in the world.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      <break/>  Knowledge is information applied to decision making.

This relationship is a reasonable derivation of Ackoff’s hierarchy, put to different ends. While Ackoff’s hierarchy generally has knowledge-as-model, another understanding of model could be <delimited detail='quotation'>“information with practical consequences.”</delimited> This view necessitates filtered information, as information contains elements both with and without practical consequences. By assigning practicality to knowledge, one can relegate the elements of pure-theory without application to information until they are filtered and contextualized by use.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       <section detail='subsection' location='aut:207'>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       <sectionnumber>8.4.3</sectionnumber>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         <sectiontitle>Survey III</sectiontitle>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         <sectioncontent> The participant is a manager of a consumer electronics repair workshop.

Thus, in my analysis, I have to default to the description <delimited detail='quotation'>“statement”</delimited>without further elaboration due to the participant’s answers.

knowledge. Knowledge as understanding or conclusions does not suggest the use to which that knowledge is put, however.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          <break/>  This survey presented difficulties due to the fuzziness of the participant’s explanations. While there is some evidence of a standard hierarchy, the relationships between the terms are poorly articulated. Here the survey did not provide enough guidance to extract from the participant their ideas on how data, information, and knowledge relate to one another.

Their self-description of their role emphasized management and planning skills with a correspondingly high information consumption. Participant overwhelmingly classified things as information, with 5 Data, 13 Information, 5 Knowledge, and 3 Other. The use of Other suggests a willingness to differentiate, although it seems that from descriptions of what they wrote, some of the categorizations are in error: a few times participant categorized something as information but explained it as data. Participant differentiates emotion from the traditional hierarchy, as they categorize both mugging and poetry as flows of emotion. There is insufficient evidence to articulate how emotion relates to data. Despite these problems there seems to be some evidence for the traditional hierarchy.

This set of responses matches interviews III and IV quite well, suggesting some commonality of background. Most importantly, it suggests that the realities of data explored in those interviews were not flukes, as the <synonym detail='abbreviation' tag='SDFN'>SDFN</synonym> also produced these results.

They gave balanced categorizations to data, information, and knowledge, with an extraordinary 9 Other versus 5 Data, 6 Information, and 6 Knowledge. They used the Other category to delineate art, wisdom, and lists. Of all of the surveys so far, I am the happiest with this one because the high incidence of Other categories suggests strict definitions for the three categories of interest.

The participant is not  interested in scientific facts per se, but in records of actions that can be contextualized into information and analyzed into knowledge about the target.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              <break/>  Information is data with context and assessment:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              <itemgroup detail='itemize'>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               <item>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 <itemtag><m:math><m:mrow><m:mo>•</m:mo></m:mrow></m:math></itemtag>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 <itemcontent><delimited detail='quotation'>“As stated before, the context provides so much about m.o., etc., that this is more than mere data, but because there are critical parts missing or not understood, this is only information.”</delimited></itemcontent>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 </item>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               <item>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 <itemtag><m:math><m:mrow><m:mo>•</m:mo></m:mrow></m:math></itemtag>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 <itemcontent><delimited detail='quotation'>“This is raw data regarding what was watched and when.

Thus, the outcome of knowledge is a prediction. The nature of a prediction differs from the usual knowledge models of data-as-facts constructions. Although the participant indeed considers knowledge to be models, the nature of a prediction is such that it is an exported and actionable model upon which other people can base their activity or lack of activity. Of interest here is the traditional view that enemy actions can communicate volumes about their intelligence sources and models of worlds, as unlikely actions may indicate the presence of a leak in one’s  organization. The ability to make predictions that are given to other people, therefore, is tempered with far more severe complications than physical models of the world.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               <section detail='subsection' location='aut:215'>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               <sectionnumber>8.4.9</sectionnumber>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 <sectiontitle>Survey IX</sectiontitle>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 <sectioncontent> The participant is a housekeeper.

However, this separate meaning should not be confused with a conception of data as data-as-communications. While using data as a term for computer records is certainly possible among all of the three realities of data, those who use it as their primary construction elaborate upon it more; the idea of it being a side definition never really occurs in practice, there usually is a seamless transition in usage depending on context.

The duality of data as observations and data is very hard to reconcile. While it seems that data-as-bits is a side definition, there is no evidence to blithely dismiss it. Participant also does not indicate that data are objective, merely that they are specific, intentional observations.

While limited by the same potential bias as the interview analysis, the high variation in conceptions of data from the survey suggests that I may very well be on to something. On the other hand, the phrasing of the survey instructions suggests that I may have indicated to my participants what I was looking for, thereby eliminating scientific rigor from my experiment. For this reason, the survey results are presented as a curiosity, rather than as proof of different conceptions of data in the wider world.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              <break/>  Different roles have different uses for data, and there are differences of opinion as to the methods of knowing, intrinsic nature, and purpose of data. In the surveys, people referred to records, observations, and numbers, roughly mapping to the terms found in the interviews.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              <break/>  Records, as technologically stored signs, can be data if they are stored properly. Another term for record is row or tuple. These tuples can be about any topic and can suffer from anomalies: authoritative conflicts in which the database may not represent the thing in the universe of discourse. Despite this, to some people, any records in the database are still data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              <break/>  Observations are the act of applying consciousness to a reality. They can be subjective and inconsistent. At the same time, researchers used the term to indicate experimental observations that are objective and provide their own context. The term observation in the surveys suffers from the same traps that it does in the interviews and is worth far more research.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              <break/>  Numbers as data are used by both the database designers and the objective researchers. Numbers are either a more objective refinement of an observation or merely a  semiotic rendering that requires context and analysis to render into meaning. Numbers are the sine qua non<link><descriptionsymbol detail='footnote'><m:math><m:mrow><m:mo>*</m:mo></m:mrow></m:math></descriptionsymbol></link> of measurement, as they are the result and the goal of factual inquiry. Those who believe data are facts can use the idea of numbers to represent this.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              <break/>  However, numbers are also the without which not of databases, being a different order of thinking about a record. A number in a database sense can be either the content of a record or the sign by which a record is stored, because a series of bits are simply numbers. Both uses are evident and present evidence of a fascinating linguistic trap for future research.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              <break/>  From the point of view of question of interest 1, the surveys were a complete success: people demonstrated that they had realities of data that departed in ways far beyond mere semantic differences over subjectivity and objectivity. Furthermore, different roles tended to cluster around different understandings of the term, suggesting that educational background combined with the current uses of the term strongly inform meaning. However, from a methodological perspective, the tainting of the surveys with the item of interest leads to results that are strongly suspect. While these results are encouraging, no real conclusions may be drawn from them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               <description detail='footnote'>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               <descriptiontag><link><m:math><m:mrow><m:mo>*</m:mo></m:mrow></m:math></link></descriptiontag>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               <descriptioncontent>Without which not.   </descriptioncontent>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             </description>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             <section detail='chapter' location='aut:224'>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               <sectionnumber>9</sectionnumber>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 <sectiontitle>Different Realities of Data and the Database</sectiontitle>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 <sectioncontent> How can different realities of data can be applied to the philosophical conceptions of the database as corporate memory? Different realities of data provide a novel and interesting context in which to think about corporate databases and database design. To a database, data is an instantiation of a sign. Just as words represent both signs and reality, tuples<link><descriptionsymbol detail='footnote'><m:math><m:mrow><m:mo>*</m:mo></m:mrow></m:math></descriptionsymbol></link>in a database represent signs and the reality behind those signs. When we define data as an instantiated sign, the nature of data in a database becomes very important. Using the communicative definition of data, a database contains a number of signs and the explicitly encoded relationships between the tuples.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  <break/>  In relational databases, there exist two categories of relationships between tuples. The first, and simplest, is a grouping of tuples into tables. A table exists as a set of identically formatted tuples representing different data of similar type. The second type of relationship between tuples is relationships between tables: while tables group tuples together, tuples can relate to each other based on internal codes or information.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  <break/>  The combination of these relationships allows for the computer to encode signs as data in the form of tuples and to relate signs to each other, allowing for manipulation of the signs to create new signs, and for information processing to occur outside the brain.

Through business rules interpreting data, the computer can act on the data, pass new data to other business rules, or change the business rules themselves: the exact same relationship that a mental map has with signs in a conscious system, albeit on a much more simplified level.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  <break/>  The act of designing a database is strongly informed by the designer’s constructions of data.

I will use this as a case study in which the ramifications of realities of data are illustrated in this chapter. This case study was developed for a data warehousing course at my old university and is of sufficient complexity to illustrate some of the issues raised in this chapter. <delimited detail='extract'>TigerWine Distributors was founded in 1985 by two college friends, Miss G. and Mr. R. The company was originally based on a small family winery, founded in 1878 and passed down through Miss G’s family, and has since grown into a very successful wine distribution company. Today, the original winery is only a small portion of their business. The California based company now trades as an importer and distributor of wines throughout the United States. Over the years, TigerWine Distributors has built up an extensive portfolio of premium products and represents a large number of national and international wine wholesalers as well as many small vintners.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        <break/>  One of the greatest strengths of TigerWine Distributors is that it has contacts with the complete spectrum of the wine-sales trade from small, but prestigious, restaurants to the largest liquor stores and supermarkets. Their customers also include private individuals, regional vintners, traditional wholesalers, individual cash-and-carries, specialty stores, and other independent outlets.</delimited>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   <break/> This setup is an excellent foil, as the hereditary views of Miss G’s understanding of data as tempered by her university experience could quite plausibly differ from Mr. R’s  understanding, especially if Miss G studied a more scientific viticulture major versus’s R’s business degree. If these managers commission an analytic data warehouse for their distribution business, it is reasonable to suppose that they will understand data in different ways. To these two individuals, we will add a third, a Mrs. B, who is their CTO and the person developing their data warehouse.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      <break/>  For purposes of this case study, Miss G considers data to be reflections of objective reality, most comfortable manipulating data as observations from chemical studies of grape biology. While she admits that there is business data to be collected and analyzed, the data exist only in sales records: the movement of real things and the income derived from their movement.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      <break/>  Mr. R considers the most important <delimited detail='quotation'>“data”</delimited> in their records to be the intangibles of customer satisfaction and error rates. He has heard that the data warehouse could explore these questions but is not entirely sure what black magic needs to be applied to the <delimited detail='quotation'>“big data”</delimited> for that exploration to occur. In many ways, Mr. R considers data to be encoded human communications and is interested in how to decode those communications.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      <break/>  Mrs. B is the CTO, and therefore considers all data to be subjective recorded impressions. While she considers this in her role, she also needs to design the database so it can fulfill the requirements of the other two founders of the company. For purposes of this case study, Mrs. B will be making a data warehouse that only covers the distribution side of the company, and will be trying to understand the realities of data held by the founders.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      <break/>  Designers can encode business rules in a database in two ways. First, designers can build them into the design of the system, informing the grouping of columns, the design of tables, and the relationship of one table to another. Relationships are a way of encoding the constraints of reality into a constructed simulacrum, a database. A constraint is a  database’s way of enforcing a rule. A relationship between tuples is defined as: <delimited detail='quotation'>“this tuple may not exist without a reference to another extant tuple.”</delimited> This both encodes the specific tuple the entity being created relates to, and enforces articulation of that relationship.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      <break/>  In the context of TigerWine Distribution, the table business rules look like: <delimited detail='extract'>CASE                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        <break/>  A collection of items offered for sale; this is the fundamental unit of sale for the distribution side of the business.

The practice of the different realities does not rely on the different formulation of specific business rules, but the very choice of specification of the rules.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      <break/>  Therefore, for purposes of the case study, the question is to illustrate a table or relationship that each of the three understandings would find particularly compelling or distasteful. For data as objective measurements, Miss G would find the presence of a table of written employee evaluations without any real <delimited detail='quotation'>“data”</delimited> to back it up most objectionable. It would illustrate the worst of subjectivity, without even offering the benefits that computerized semantic analysis of a mass of product reviews. The tables she would most approve of would be the automated sensor readings from the distribution warehouses of the stock that was on each shelf. Miss G would also object to normalization because it splits one <delimited detail='quotation'>“observation”</delimited> across multiple tables; as the meta-data for the observation belongs in a different table than the data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      <break/>  Mr. R as someone who holds data as subjective observations, is nominally "okay" with <delimited detail='quotation'>“anything”</delimited> in the database, so long as it accurately reflects reality. Mr. R is not  interested in the merits or lack thereof of normalization, so long as the database accurately reflects the subjective impressions of reality that he wants it to encode. In a way, this means that Mr. R treats all entities within the database as <delimited detail='quotation'>“equal data”</delimited> with no one tuple privileged against any other due to its intrinsic truth or relationship to the universe. Mr R especially dislikes tables that are not internally consistent within the rules of the database: just because reality gives people multiple phone numbers does not mean that there should be multiple phone number fields in the <delimited detail='quotation'>“person”</delimited> table, even after the fact. For Mr R, if reality changes, the database should be reengineered to reflect that reality accurately without consideration for the costs or impacts on established software. Without a consistent and useful database structure, the queries to manipulate and transform the presentation of data in the database will fail.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      <break/>  Mrs. B considers data to be encoded human communications or encoded information. Therefore, the database tables are a repository of human interactions with the world, curated and made searchable by other humans. Any design that interferes with that curation is discouraged, as it makes the task of the maintainer that much more difficult. Because the tables in a database have on ontological value to Mrs B, she is comfortable with whatever arrangement of tables that will work best with the programs that support human communication. Any table arrangement that exists for the data’s sake rather than to support the programs that support human communication is pointless and wasteful effort. For example, normalized relations that introduce inefficiencies for the purpose of avoiding rare or even purely theoretical data anomalies is to be fiercely resisted: it is inefficient and does not serve human communication. Instead, it gets in the way of programmers and therefore makes the encoded data less likely to be presented to the users.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       <break/>  The other, more significant way, is with queries<link><descriptionsymbol detail='footnote'><m:math><m:mrow><m:mo>*</m:mo></m:mrow></m:math></descriptionsymbol></link>: exposing and relating signs in a predetermined format. The real power of queries, however, is that the data they output can be used as the inputs for subsequent queries: just like a sign or group of signs, one mental model can output data to another mental model for further interpretation. A query draws upon the encoded business rules in the database and applies some criteria to find only interesting entries of interest. These entries can be composed from multiple tables, even positing characteristics not originally planned for in the database but derivable from available evidence.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      <break/>  The importance of this similarity cannot be understated. When I discuss databases, I am talking about the seat of external memory and cognition for distributed cognition. Whereas other entities shape and perform I/O on the database, as well as on their own interpretation, most of the processing in a database happens through the use of business rules, either as constraints on database design or the implicit contextualization of data via queries.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      <break/>  Queries with regards to different realities of data, are simply structures to produce the desiderata as a function of expectations of the querent. The actual structure of the query to produce the same information varies little based on the coder’s conception of data, as there are <delimited detail='quotation'>“right”</delimited> and <delimited detail='quotation'>“wrong”</delimited> ways to access information in a database dictated solely by the efficiency of a particular query.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      <break/>  While there are techno-philosophical approaches on more sophisticated queries with their representation within the database and the methods used to construct them: mainly varying the complexity of individual queries and whether or not they the output is collated within the <delimited detail='quotation'>“host”</delimited> programming language.

A programmer who views data as non-atomic will be more <delimited detail='quotation'>“comfortable”</delimited> making giant queries as the idea of splitting apart tuples and recombining them in an extended chain does not produce a cognitive dissonance in the programmer’s mind. However, for realities of data that are less about semiotic manipulation and who consider a tuple an observed or recorded fact, intermediate translation stages within the context of a more comfortable functional programming language would necessarily appeal more: there is no violation of objectivity in operating upon retrieved data as contrasted with reformulating the presentation of that retrieved data within the data retrieval system itself.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      <break/>  Assuming that all three founders are sufficiently comfortable with programming languages and database systems to write queries, we can approach this from their perspective. Miss G, with her reality of data as objective representation, would prefer to retrieve numerical data gathered by automated systems and sensors.

SQL is powerful because it can produce unusual and post de facto relationships through the mechanism of queries. Mr. R is the most comfortable of the three producing <delimited detail='quotation'>“new”</delimited> information through the transformative properties of queries, and sees nothing wrong with encoding a long query that touches many tables to produce a novel and interesting output. In a sense, Mr. R. would like to be able to <delimited detail='quotation'>“persuade”</delimited> the database to produce the results he wants.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      <break/>  Mr. R is most interested in manipulating and analyzing the text as input in customer and performance reviews. Because nothing in the system is objectively true, the things which are more rich in human meaning, e.g. words, are more useful than the things which require significant statistical analysis to extract meaning from, such as numbers produced via sensor observations. The presence and analysis of the text in the database is an interesting challenge, rather than an irrelevancy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      <break/>  Mrs B. is not particularly interested in the analysis of stored data. As all of this is a stored semiotic representation of human information, the primary purpose of the database is to efficiently retrieve wanted records for humans to manipulate without  any incorrect or wasted retrievals. As efficiency of communications is everything and humans are necessary for transforming the data into information, Mrs. B is less interested in automated analysis and complex queries than R or G. However, she recognizes that these tasks are desirable from R and G’s standpoint and will try to design the database accordingly, creating specialized <delimited detail='quotation'>“views”</delimited> (permanent queries which can be treated as tables) to suit both of their requirements. Her queries and manipulations of the database will be designed around efficiency and speed of retrieval and access rather than the semantic content of the data itself.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       <section detail='section' location='aut:230'>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       <sectionnumber>9.2</sectionnumber>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         <sectiontitle>System Models and Mental Maps</sectiontitle>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         <sectioncontent> The semiotic concept of the system model for databases [<link destination='1:Borgman1986' location='1:Borgman1986'>60</link> and <link destination='1:Storey1999' location='1:Storey1999'>61</link>] is the mental map of the designer instantiated in business rules and relationships<link><descriptionsymbol detail='footnote'><m:math><m:mrow><m:mo>*</m:mo></m:mrow></m:math></descriptionsymbol></link>.

This confusion may be compounded by those stations that are open to the train platforms, because they are too small to justify the staff that ticket-taking stations would require. Thus, the user’s actions with his or her ticket may not correspond to the expected actions by the designers of the ticket system, and from this basis, mistakes occur.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          <break/>  From the perspectives of the three founders of TigerWine distributors, they have been working together long enough for a shared pidgin to spring up around the database.

This documentation then allows the programs to provide better contextualization of the data for human consumption.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           <section detail='section' location='aut:234'>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           <sectionnumber>9.3</sectionnumber>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             <sectiontitle>The Consequences of Error</sectiontitle>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             <sectioncontent> The system model interprets reality into an abstract model of relationships and norms or business rules. A good system model corresponds well to reality: relationships in the map correlate with reality. The proof of a pudding is in the eating and the proof of a system map is in the using. Systems generate system maps in their user through exposed affordances. If the affordances designed into the user interface correspond with how users think they should behave, the users have a good system map.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              <break/>  A system model that is poorly envisioned or implemented, either because of design errors or misunderstanding of the user’s realities of data, causes multiple types of potential error [<link destination='1:Codd1990' location='1:Codd1990'>62</link>]: data corruption, data deviation, and misinterpretation. As the system map deviates from reality, the incidence of the three types of error named above becomes ever more likely.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               <break/>  Data corruption stems from where a system model does not allow or require sufficient updates from systems that observe reality. As parts of the system correspond to earlier realities, they increasingly fail to reflect the current reality. Errors breed. In a system where an interaction produces the right result for the wrong reason, the user does not become aware of their mistake. In fact, a mistake only occurs if there are observed secondary effects that were not desired by the user. However, further interactions may lead these second (and third) order mistakes to create their own changes to the system’s state, turning what was an unnoticeable mistake into something that can bring the entire system to a screeching collapse. An example of such a problem is seen in preventative car maintenance. If a car is improperly maintained, nothing will happen initially. As systems fall out of timing, lose their lubrication, and suffer other failure-of-maintenance effects, these failures cause other systems to break down. These secondary systems may light the <delimited detail='quotation'>“idiot lights”</delimited> in the dashboard, but for a bad driver, it is not until a furious boil of smoke escapes from the engine that they are confronted with their mistake. If those incidental problems are fixed without due thought, the underlying causes will simply cause other systems to fail until the car is written off as a total loss. This unfortunate outcome is purely due to the user’s system model diverging from the car’s reality.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              <break/>  The second type of error is data deviation. Whereas data corruption stems from data falling out of synchronization with reality, data deviation starts with the data being out of synchronization due to a database design that cannot accurately reflect reality. Incorrect assumptions, norms, or ignorance can lead to data deviation. I can draw a trivial example from a special case of postal mail: <delimited detail='quotation'>“general delivery”</delimited> that may instruct mail to go to a centralized post office to be held for pickup. Corporate database systems may not be designed to recognize general delivery, nor may they have business rules suitable for letters addressed under general delivery notation. Geographic Information  Systems have even had problems mapping other post office special cases (Postal Boxes) to geographic location for purposes of illness tracking [<link destination='1:Hurley2003' location='1:Hurley2003'>63</link>]. These problems are data deviations, in which reality does not conform to the database and errors occur when there is an irreconcilable mismatch.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              <break/>  Misinterpretation, on the other hand, stems from problems in others’ interpretation of tuples in the database. As the interfaces access the database, the system models of the interface designers may map the meanings of the relationships and the tables in the database incorrectly. This leads to interfaces which present the context of data incorrectly and thereby a cascading failure of meaning which eventually leads to mistake and error.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              <break/>  Corruption stemming from different realities of data requires more research at this time. My research did not provide sufficient evidence to make useful specific examples of the secondary and tertiary effects described above.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              <break/>  The data warehouse envisioned by G, R, and B, may experience some deviation. Data deviation would stem from a mis-implemented ETL stage by Mrs. B. In this deviation, if the transformation misunderstands the reliability or meaning of the column being translated, the new column could appear correct in its new context but have its meaning shifted significantly. One probable cause of this error is misunderstood labels for financial transactions, altering the <delimited detail='quotation'>“start and stop”</delimited> time periods of some transaction aggregations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              <break/>  Misinterpretation in Mrs B’s data warehouse would stem from Miss G and Mr. R misunderstanding the documentation of the tables. While this looks like data deviation, the error of misunderstanding happens during data consumption rather than data recording and is a function of in-company documentation and communication practices. Because miscommunications occur when the designer fails to express her intentions correctly, it is a discrete category with different failure modes than deviation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               <section detail='section' location='aut:237'>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               <sectionnumber>9.4</sectionnumber>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 <sectiontitle>Database as Corporate Mind</sectiontitle>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 <sectioncontent> It may even be possible to extend the new understandings of the reality of data to an exploration of the philosophy of the corporate mind, for a corporation’s memory is in its databases.

This important link between the database and reality requires that the database designer’s system model corresponds well with reality to reduce errors in database design.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  <break/>  A tragic example of the problems of corporate memory occurs in the story of the American MERS Corporation, a tiny corporation that maintains a database of most mortgages held and transferred for securitization [<link destination='1:Smith2011' location='1:Smith2011'>65</link>]. <delimited detail='extract'>The implication is that MERS is superior to the local courthouse system. The evidence is the reverse. Chris Peterson has described the utterly unorthodox corporate governance system of MERS, where employees of other firms put on a MERS hat for a short period as a <delimited detail='quotation'>“MERS certifying officer”</delimited> and execute documents. MERS does not supervise these individuals. Indeed, it specifically disavows any responsibility for the accuracy of MERS’s records: MERS makes no representations or warranties regarding the accuracy or reliability of the information provided. MERS disclaims responsibility or liability for errors, omissions, and the accuracy of any information provided. MERS does not input  any of the information found on the MERS(r) System, but rather the MERS Members have that responsibility regarding mortgage loans in which they hold an interest. ... And there are widespread indications of member non-compliance with MERS processes, such as making assignments without having proper corporate authorization (including out of bankrupt entities). Moreover, the updating of records by MERS members is strictly voluntary.</delimited>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               <break/> Thus, banks are using MERS as their memory; they cause it to be a model that reflects their reality. However, they have no obligation to keep the model accurate, and have no recourse or backups when problem arise because MERS is so much more efficient than the traditional paper audit trails. This conflict of priorities produces predictable results: an error-filled foreclosure process with many parties fighting over the reality of possession before courts and the U.S. congress.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  <break/>  To a corporation, errors in database design allow signs to be encoded into the database that do not correspond to reality. Therefore, the corporation’s actions will deviate from the most optimal, because the corporation is endeavoring to solve a problem that only has a tangential relationship to reality. Poor system models beget worse system models. It is inevitable that database design passes from the initial designer to subsequent designers employed to make changes to the database.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  <break/>  With a poor system model, only the most glaring of errors advertise that they are errors. Other errors simply alter the corporation’s responses to reality without causing agents to realize that the responses do not perfectly correspond. In the latter case, as secondary designers attempt to change the database to adapt to changing business conditions, the initial system model residing within the designer’s imagination influences all subsequent system models. Without careful consideration and reflection at each stage, the errors induced by the database structure cause the database to diverge further and further from reality.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   <break/>  In context of the example of TigerWine Distribution, they suffer from a glaring error in their system model: wine is identified by the case, and only with difficulty as individual bottles. Because they associate wine with cases of wine, the most obvious error is that they won’t identify other opportunities to sell bottles or unusual containers of wine. The <delimited detail='quotation'>“with difficulty”</delimited> above indicates that their marketing department forced through a change: promotions could contain bottles of wine as well as unusual items like corkscrews or cheese. This presents a logical disconnect within the database itself: half the company understands wine as something which comes in a case, and the other half understands wine as something that appears inside a pre-packaged promotion. While the humans involved are certainly smart enough to understand the em nature of a case of wine, the fact that these ontological descriptors of containers are hardcoded into the database informs the corporate identification of objects and its behavior towards them. As the technology ages and new systems are built upon the old technology, it is quite possible for these artificial divisions to be encoded in the new systems like unto laws of nature. This subsequent generation is when the <delimited detail='quotation'>“schizophrenia”</delimited> sets into the corporate mind, as the databases state a thing that is simply not true in <delimited detail='quotation'>“reality”</delimited> but fully accepted as true within the corporate memory.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  <break/>  Fixing errors in a production system is difficult as <delimited detail='quotation'>“the cost of fixing errors grows exponentially as a function of elapsed time to discovery.”</delimited> [<link destination='1:Wand2002' location='1:Wand2002'>66</link>] Since these errors exist in a production system that has run for some time, the cost of fixing the errors is prohibitive at the stage when the errors are found. The only way to insure that the system model of the database designers keeps the system in line with reality is to inspect the database and insure that it corresponds with reality within the required specifications.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  <break/>  By understanding the impact the various users’ realities of data has on a database and on corporate memory, this philosophy of corporate mind combined with an under  standing of how we conceive of data can provide tools for a data modeler to create better databases. Normal database modeling methods are quite formalized, exploring the relationship of tuples to each other and whether or not to split them into new tables. Other database design methods simply instantiate the tables of a <delimited detail='quotation'>“default”</delimited> database and allow the designer to connect new tables and data structures to the pre-extant core<link><descriptionsymbol detail='footnote'><m:math><m:mrow><m:mo>*</m:mo></m:mrow></m:math></descriptionsymbol></link>. In many ways, most database-creation methodologies already expect the designer to understand the participants’ realities.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  <break/>  When teaching database design, I had students create data-flow diagrams mapping the current reality. They then updated the <synonym detail='abbreviation' tag='DFD'>DFD</synonym>’s so that they could reflect some sort of more coherent <delimited detail='quotation'>“future reality”</delimited> and created the database design from that. The process of updating designs from current reality to future reality was never explicitly spelled out, merely left as a <delimited detail='quotation'>“well, you should solve this yourself”</delimited> method for the students. An understanding of the various realities of data, and especially of how different people understand data, may provide for better database design.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  <break/>  An understanding of data will provide for better design neither by increasing normalization<link><descriptionsymbol detail='footnote'><m:math><m:mrow><m:mi>†</m:mi></m:mrow></m:math></descriptionsymbol></link> nor by providing better requirements-collection methods.

users perceive the nature of data. In a more limited sense, I wanted to demonstrate that users have different conceptions of data and a method for discovering hints as to how they use and understand data. In that light, I have been successful. This research should serve as the foundation to more specific and focused studies into the different social constructions of data present in our societies and what epistemological and ontological basis data may have.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      <break/>  With the use of the term “raw data” there is some evidence for trading zones being established as people with different usages of data must discuss it to function in the same way. In a more limited sense, this evidence may just be an artifact of the narrowness of the study. Either way, more indication into the establishment of trading zones with different technological concepts is strongly indicated.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       <section detail='section' location='aut:245'>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       <sectionnumber>10.1</sectionnumber>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         <sectiontitle>Results</sectiontitle>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         <sectioncontent> People have different realities of data. My methods are capable of generally distinguishing between different realities. I have found three distinct realities: data as communications, data as subjective observations, and data as objective facts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          <break/>  In the data-as-communications category, users generally consider data to be electronically encoded semiotic representations, or bits stored on a computer. Although some people in this category believe that data are any communications (i.e., data are signs), most believe that data are re-encoded and computerized signs. This construction tends to share some space with the other understandings in the sense that people can use the term <delimited detail='quotation'>“data”</delimited> in an electronic sense when referring to <delimited detail='quotation'>“computer data”</delimited> and in  the <delimited detail='quotation'>“proper”</delimited> sense of facts or observations. However, even in that case, there is more a blending of the two meanings rather than two distinct meanings.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          <break/>  There are people who classify data as observations. Observations, in this case, are any acts in which a sensor (such as the brain and eye) takes note of the world. These observations are then filtered according to some knowledge and situated with context as information. All observations are data, but not all data is important. Only data situated properly in the correct context can be assessed for utility.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          <break/>  Considering data-as-facts, people equate facts with objective, true, statements about the world, and comprehend data as small facts about specific parts of the world. Facts are a superset of data, information, or knowledge, being objective and truthful statements about the world regardless of scope. People in this category tend to favor strongly objectivist views of science and tend to be scientists and some types of engineers. Data as facts does not require external context, and is packed with its own meta-data: its precision, provenance, reliability, and reproducibility, among other things. Data as facts strongly tend to be numbers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          <break/>  It is clear from the, admittedly biased, results of the surveys that many other variations exist on these three simple categories. These findings are in no way exhaustive, merely suggestive of what I found in the majority of my interviews and surveys. It is obvious to me that far more research is necessary before any definitive statements can be made about the different realities of data present and, especially, their possible interactions and failure modes with each other.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          <break/>  The Social Data Flow Network has great utility as an reality-discovery methodology. The <synonym detail='abbreviation' tag='SDFN'>SDFN</synonym>, inspired by the data flow diagram methodology of systems design, is quite able to cause participants to differentiate between practical definitions and theoretical definitions when discussing a participant’s construction of data. And is therefore better  than more focused requirements gathering methodologies at this task.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          <break/>  The <synonym detail='abbreviation' tag='SDFN'>SDFN</synonym> produced many useful discussions of data, causing participants to reflect on their own working definitions and on how they contrast with formal or intuitive definitions. The propensity for generating self-reflection is a useful product of the iterative categorization of the <synonym detail='abbreviation' tag='SDFN'>SDFN</synonym>. This process of iterative categorization provides mechanisms for inspecting peoples’ functioning definitions, rather than the theoretical definitions under discussion.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          <break/>  The internal consistency of the results between the analysis of the transcript and the analysis of the diagrams suggests that the generation of the <synonym detail='abbreviation' tag='SDFN'>SDFN</synonym> diagrams provides a useful triangulation method for both reflection during the interview and subsequent analysis. However, the <synonym detail='abbreviation' tag='SDFN'>SDFN</synonym> requires significant refinement: it must be made less intimidating; steps must be made to make analysis easier; it needs to be codified such that other people can perform both the collection and analysis stages of the <synonym detail='abbreviation' tag='SDFN'>SDFN</synonym>..                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           <section detail='section' location='aut:246'>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           <sectionnumber>10.2</sectionnumber>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             <sectiontitle>Methodological conclusions</sectiontitle>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             <sectioncontent> The interviews via <synonym detail='abbreviation' tag='SDFN'>SDFN</synonym> and surveys were successful. The <synonym detail='abbreviation' tag='SDFN'>SDFN</synonym> diagrams were useful in producing directed discussions which uncovered personal realities of data. My chosen research group, the fine engineers, scientists, and researchers at the company I conducted interviews at, were a fantastic initial target. The group presented a number of different trading zones as scientists and engineers interacted in a highly competitive area. The research was both practical and theoretical and had to show progress on both fronts, creating many different goals and many different research languages.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              <break/>  The informal atmosphere also presented significant advantages. My interactions with the team allowed for a sense of reassuring informality in the interviews while the non-interview interactions (mainly sharing meals) allowed for a sense of rapport that  helped the difficult sections of the interviews slide past. This informality allowed people to communicate their insights without worries that what they were going to say would backfire.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              <break/>  The survey in practical matters was a partial success. Although the second survey was generally able to probe the thoughts of the participants, a number of people thought the survey had a different intent, and thus their answers presumed different questions than those I asked. As such, the wording and the scenarios could be tightened. All things considered, however, the survey’s results are acceptable for use, but could stand quite a lot of work to improve their reproducibility and accuracy. Nonetheless, the survey presented some useful insights as to how wildly different people understand the nature of data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               <section detail='section' location='aut:247'>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               <sectionnumber>10.3</sectionnumber>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 <sectiontitle>Further Research</sectiontitle>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 <sectioncontent> Further research will be pursuing two primary goals: methodological improvement and philosophical exploration of the philosophy of data.

All the further research directions must be focused in integrating philosophy with practice. Research that involves practitioners and enhances their capabilities for meta-reflection is good research. Research that isolates practitioners and returns nothing is bad research.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  <break/>  This section cannot articulate all the possible research directions, for there are too many unknown unknowns.
