\section[Summary]{Summary of Interview Analysis}


\startitemize
\item Pilot interview:
\startitemize
\item Data is a menial-interpersonal communication.
\item Data is a menial-technical communication.
\item No hierarchy specified.
\stopitemize

\item Interview II
\startitemize
\item Data is an electronic container for human-produced information and knowledge.
\item Data does not transform.
\stopitemize

\item Interview III
\startitemize
\item Data is a subjective observation.
\item Experimental data is not data, an exception that allows for quality and less subjectivity.
\item Sometimes data is a communication.
\item Data can create information and knowledge and information is structured data.

\stopitemize
\item Interview IV
\startitemize
\item Data is a subjective, discrete observation with specific provenance and reliability: \quotation{the ability to specify \quote{what, where, when} would define a piece of that, what the measure of it was, and its location at the time.}
\item Representations of data are not data.
\item Data participates in a cyclic hierarchy, being filtered by knowledge and being contextualized into information. 

\stopitemize
\item Interview V
\startitemize
\item Data are the fundamental relationships of matter, which are themselves measurable and observable.
\item Data can become information and knowledge by adding context and abstraction.

\stopitemize
\item Interview VI
\startitemize
\item Data are facts created from objective sensors and experiments.
\item They can be input to mathematical models, contextualized with information, and generalized with knowledge.
\item Standard hierarchy: data produce information, which produces knowledge.

\stopitemize
\item Interview VII
\startitemize
\item Data are numbers: \quotation{Data is a multi-dimensional collection of data points. A data point is a number.} Data points are created from experiments.
\item Standard hierarchy.

\stopitemize
\item Interview VIII
\startitemize
\item Information as container for data and knowledge.
\item Data are factual representations of measurements.
\item No hierarchy.

\stopitemize
\item Interview IX
\startitemize
\item Data are numbers, no requirement of objectivity: \quotation{Look, you can put them in a list. There is a defined quantity. They can be grouped, they can be ordered or whatever. They probably are data. You can put them in a spreadsheet.}
\item Cyclic hierarchy: Data, interpreted with knowledge creates information. Information analyzed creates knowledge.

\stopitemize
\item Interview X
\startitemize
\item Data are contextualized \quotation{hard} numbers as observed representations of reality.
\item Data as apex of ontological hierarchy.
\item Tuomi-reversed hierarchy.

\stopitemize
