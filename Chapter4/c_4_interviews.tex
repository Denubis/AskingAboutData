\section{Interviews}

To avoid weasel words such as \quotation{participant seems,} every interview description will be written in strong language with categorical statements about the nature of data, information, and knowledge. These are my observations and interpretations from what the participants stated as refined through recursive analysis, not my own philosophies. Further testing is required before these statements can be codified into any kind of statement covering many peopleâ€™s constructions of data. As one of the end products of my methodologies is a person-specific understanding for the interviewer to the participant, I feel that these analyses will capture that specific understanding and already provide a useful tool for any designers of databases or interfaces who want to use my methodologies.
