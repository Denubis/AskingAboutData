@article{Swanson2004b,
abstract = {Although organizational innovation with information technology is often carefully considered, bandwagon phenomena indicate that much innovative behavior may nevertheless be of the "me too" variety. In this essay, we explore such differences in innovative behavior. Adopting a perspective that is both institutional and cognitive, we introduce the notion of mindful innovation with IT. A mindful firm attends to an IT innovation with reasoning grounded in its own organizational facts and specifics. We contrast this with mindless innovation, where a firm's actions betray an absence of such attention and grounding. We develop these concepts by drawing on the recent appearance of the idea of mindfulness in the organizational literature, and adapting it for application to IT innovation. We then bring mindfulness and mindlessness together in a larger theoretical synthesis in which these apparent opposites are seen to interact in ways that help to shape the overall landscape of opportunity for organizational innovation with IT. We conclude by suggesting several promising new research directions.},

abstract = {We do not, it seems, have a very clear and commonly agreed upon set of notions about data---either what they are, how they should be fed and cared for, or their relation to the design of programming languages and operating systems. This paper sketches a theory of data which may serve to clarify these questions. It is based on a number of old ideas and may, as a result, seem obvious. Be that as it may, some of these old ideas are not common currency in our field, either separately or in combination; it is hoped that rehashing them in a somewhat new form may prove to be at least suggestive.},

@article{Zins2007,
abstract = {The ﬁeld of Information Science is constantly changing. Therefore, information scientists are required to regularly review-and if necessary—redeﬁne its fundamental building blocks. This article is one of a group of four articles, which resulted from a Critical Delphi study conducted in 2003–2005. The study, "Knowledge Map of Information Science," was aimed at exploring the foundations of information science. The international panel was composed of 57 leading scholars from 16 countries, who represent (almost) all the major subﬁelds and important aspects of the ﬁeld. This particular article documents 130 deﬁnitions of data, information, and knowledge formulated by 45 scholars, and maps the major conceptual approaches for deﬁning these three key concepts.

Mealy's definitions and positions will be paraphrased. This is not to suggest that others have not made contributions.

Through a review of the historical literature, this paper shows that, in fact, the distinction is not obvious, that it is an outgrowth of work in the information systems area, and that the distinction is not clearly understood. The paper briefly notes some of the implications of this historical development for information systems theory. This paper will be of interest primarily to academics and those with an interest in the conceptual foundations and theoretical frameworks guiding Information Systems research.},

@article{Floridi2003,
abstract = {There is no consensus yet on the definition of semantic information. This paper contributes to the current debate by criticising and revising the Standard Definition of semantic Information (SDI) as meaningful data, in favour of the Dretske-Grice approach: meaningful and well-formed data constitute semantic information only if they also qualify as contingently truthful. After a brief introduction, SDI is criticised for providing necessary but insufficient conditions for the definition of semantic information. SDI is incorrect because truth-values do not supervene on semantic information, and misinformation (that is, false semantic information) is not a type of semantic information, but pseudo-information, that is not semantic information at all. This is shown by arguing that none of the reasons for interpreting misinformation as a type of semantic information is convincing, whilst there are compelling reasons to treat it as pseudo-information. As a consequence, SDI is revised to include a necessary truth-condition. The last section summarises the main results of the paper and indicates the important implications of the revised definition for the analysis of the deflationary theories of truth, the standard definition of knowledge and the classic, quantitative theory of semantic information.},
