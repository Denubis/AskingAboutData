	organizational change. Who better to zero in on organizations, take
	them apart and then suggest ways of putting them back together -

  abstract = {Peirce's Sign Theory, or Semiotic, is an account of signification,
	representation, reference and meaning. Although sign theories have
	a long history, Peirce's accounts are distinctive and innovative
	for their breadth and complexity, and for capturing the importance
	of interpretation to signification. For Peirce, developing a thoroughgoing
	theory of signs was a central philosophical and intellectual preoccupation.
	The importance of semiotic for Peirce is wide ranging. As he himself
	said, “[\ldots] it has never been in my power to study anything,—mathematics,
	ethics, metaphysics, gravitation, thermodynamics, optics, chemistry,
	comparative anatomy, astronomy, psychology, phonetics, economics,
	the history of science, whist, men and women, wine, metrology, except
	as a study of semiotic”. (SS 1977, 85–6). Peirce also treated
	sign theory as central to his work on logic, as the medium for inquiry
	and the process of scientific discovery, and even as one possible
	means for 'proving' his pragmatism. Its importance in Peirce's philosophy,
	then, cannot be underestimated.},

	their central and abiding reliance on direct and continuous interaction
	with those who are the ultimate arbiters of system adequacy; namely,
	those who will use the technology in their everyday lives and work.
	A key issue throughout is the question of who does what to whom:
	whose interests are at stake, who initiates action and for what reason,
	who defines the problem and who decides that there is one. The papers
	presented follow in the footsteps of a small but growing international
	community of scholars and practitioners of participatory systems
	design. Many of the original European perspectives are represented
	here as well as some new and distinctively American approaches. The
	collection is characterized by a rich anddiverse set of perspectives
	and experiences that, despite their differences, share a distinctive
	spirit and direction -- a more humane, creative, and effective relationship
	between those involved in technology's design and use, and between
	technology and the human activities that motivate the technology.},

  pages = {301},
  address = {Oxford},
  abstract = {Reassembling the Social is a fundamental challenge from one of the
	world's leading social theorists to how we understand society and
	the 'social'. Bruno Latour's contention is that the word 'social'
	as used by Social Scientists has become laden with assumptions to
	the point where it has become a misnomer. When the adjective is applied
	to a phenomenon, it is used to indicate a stabilized state of affairs,
	a bundle of ties that in due course may be used to account for another
	phenomenon. Latour also finds the word used as if it described a
	type of material, in a comparable way to an adjective such as 'wooden'
	or 'steely'. Rather than simply indicating what is already assembled
	together, it is now used in a way that makes assumptions about the
	nature of what is assembled. It has become a word that designates
	two distinct things: a process of assembling: and a type of material,
	distinct from others. Latour shows why 'the social' cannot be thought
	of as a kind of material or domain, and disputes attempts to provide
	a 'social explanation' of other states of affairs. While these attempts
	have been productive (and probably necessary) in the past, the very
	success of the social sciences mean that they are largely no longer
	so. At the present stage it is no longer possible to inspect the
	precise constituents entering the social domain. Latour returns to
	the original meaning of 'the social' to redefine the notion and allow
	it to trace connections again. It will then be possible to resume
	the traditional goal of the social sciences, but using more refined
	tools. Drawing on his extensive work examining the 'assemblages'
	of nature, Latour finds it necessary to scrutinize thoroughly the
	exact content of what is assembled under the umbrella of Society.
	This approach, a 'sociology of associations' has become known as
	Actor-Network-Theory, and this book is an essential introduction
	both for those seeking to understand Actor-Network-Theory, or the
	ideas of one of its most influential proponents.},

	socially constructed vs material, macro vs micro, and qualitative
	vs quantitative) that persist in investigations of the interaction

	University find themselves with a pocket universe on their hands:
	Roundworld, where neither magic nor common sense seems to stand a
	chance against logic. The Universe, of course, is our own. And Roundworld
	is Earth. As the wizards watch their accidental creation grow, we
	follow the story of our universe from the primal singularity of the
	Big Bang to the Internet and beyond. Through this original Terry
	Pratchett story (with intervening chapters from Cohen and Stewart)
	we discover how puny and insignificant individual lives are against
	a cosmic backdrop of creation and disaster. Yet, paradoxically, we
	see how the richness of a universe based on rules, has led to a complex
	world and at least one species that tried to get a grip of what was
	going on...},

	their central and abiding reliance on direct and continuous interaction
	with those who are the ultimate arbiters of system adequacy; namely,
	those who will use the technology in their everyday lives and work.
	A key issue throughout is the question of who does what to whom:
	whose interests are at stake, who initiates action and for what reason,
	who defines the problem and who decides that there is one. The papers
	presented follow in the footsteps of a small but growing international
	community of scholars and practitioners of participatory systems
	design. Many of the original European perspectives are represented
	here as well as some new and distinctively American approaches. The
	collection is characterized by a rich anddiverse set of perspectives
	and experiences that, despite their differences, share a distinctive
	spirit and direction -- a more humane, creative, and effective relationship
	between those involved in technology's design and use, and between

	the history and context of the debate, its implications and its afterlife.
	The importance of science and technology in policy run largely by

	of fragmentation threatening hopes for a common culture are just

  pages = {326},
  abstract = {Relevance, first published in 1986, was named as one of the most important
	and influential books of the decade in the Times Higher Educational
	Supplement. This revised edition includes a new Preface outlining
	developments in Relevance Theory since 1986, discussing the more
	serious criticisms of the theory, and envisaging possible revisions
	or extensions. The book sets out to lay the foundation for a unified
	theory of cognitive science. The authors argue than human cognition
	has a goal: we pay attention only to information which seems to us
	relevant. To communicate is to claim someone's attention, and hence
	to imply that the information communicated is relevant. Thus, a single
	property - relevance is seen as the key to human communication and
	cognition. A second important feature of the book is its approach
	to the study of reasoning. It elucidates the role of background or
	contextual information in spontaneous inference, and shows that non-demonstrative
	inference processes can be fruitfully analysed as a form of suitably
	constrained guesswork. It directly challenges recent claims that
	human central thought processes are likely to remain a mystery for
	some time to come. Thirdly, the authors offer new insight into language
	and literature, radically revising current view on the nature and
	goals of verbal comprehension, and in particular on metaphor, irony,
	style, speech acts, presupposition and implicature.},

	provide a critical analysis of the scaffolding metaphor, with particular

	an enriched version of the metaphor is presented. At the heart of
	the proposed revision is an emphasis on the communicational dynamics
	and conceptual reorganization involved in adult--child interactions.
	With an enriched metaphor as a frame, the next section reviews applications
	of the scaffolding metaphor to the study of parent--child interactions
	and teacher--student instructional activities involving children
	with learning disabilities. The strengths and limitations of this
	work are evaluated, and proposals are made for how to reap further
	benefits from applications of the scaffolding metaphor to analyses
