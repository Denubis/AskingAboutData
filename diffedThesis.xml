I think a good way to segue into the entity diagram is  to tell me what project you think you handle -- that are data-important or that are knowledge important.
  Participant: Do you want me to distinguish the two?
  Interviewer: Feel free to...
  Participant: Clearly data is important -- not clearly. Data is important in a project such as the one that [Name] is working on. Data is also impotant in a project such as [Name] is working on. In both cases I’m not talking about any project I’m involved with. Data is also important in a project that I’m involved with which is related to changing the Noun 30 Noun 21 blend in the noun 60. Now you asked about knowledge, and information, as well?
  Participant: Information is important in each of those. In my definition of knowledge.
  Interviewer: and knowledge as well?
  Participant: Oh yeah, yeah.
  Interviewer: So let’s do the one you’re involved in to start with, and if we have time, lets do your view and your role in the one that’s [name]’s involved in. But let’s do the one you’re involved in. And you mentioned a mathematical model.
  Participant: That’s what I was involved with, yeah. It won’t impact on this one though.
  Interviewer: Hopefully if we have time after the modelling, I’d love to talk about how you use data to inform and to create and then to use inside the mathematical model. Just to have that simmering in the background. Let’s start with an entity dictionary.
  Interviewer: How would you characterize yourself? Here, what we’re looking at is not just you as you, but each of the roles you’re in. So, for example, for me, at the university, one of my roles would be noun 91. student, and that would be separate from teaching assistant. So that’s the kind of roles that I think are best to start with when we’re working on our entity dictionary. ...
  Interviewer: We begin by looking at a trivial flow between something and something else in the project you’re participating in.
  Participant: The project involves noun 35 with an external organization. So we have an entity called the noun 36. I can name it if it helps you.
  Interviewer: Not really. So, what stuff is flowing to and from these guys?
  Participant: noun 37. Noun 21.
  ...
  Participant: So that’s a physical noun 37. They also send noun 37 characteristics, so that’s data. noun 37 characteristics or properties. Chemical properties if you want.
  Interviewer: would it be better to say noun 37 characteristics?
  Participant: Characteristics is probably sufficient.
  Interviewer: This is Data?
  Participant: That’s Data.
  Interviewer: Would you characterize the phsyical noun 37 as Data, Information, Knowledge, or just?
  Participant: It’s the means, really. It’s not data. It’s not Knowledge. They’re just phsyical noun 37.
  Interviewer: So we have our initial flows. What other flows are there?
  Participant: So here’s the position 32 over here, that’s me. We haven’t split -- this is the research organization, so there are people within this organization -- well, there’s probably one person if you want who’s the position 100 here. So you could actually say “position 40” So, flow from here to here is the noun 42 experiment. Over here we have position 39 who help to define the noun 42.
  Interviewer: so what do they provide?
  Participant: They provide information to assist in noun 95ing the noun 42.
  Interviewer: So the noun 42 is information? or Knowledge?
  Participant: It’s information. It’s information provided to the position 41 here to allow that person to undertake test work of a specific nature. It’s guidance into what it is they’re going to test. We’ve sent them noun 37 and a noun 42.
  Interviewer: How can we label this flow from position 39 to you of information? So you’re sending them a noun 42, and the position 39 are sending you Information to assist in the noun 42. Do we label it as Information to assist in noun 42?
  Participant: I think information to help noun 95 noun 42.
  Interviewer: What else?
  Participant: Within here there’s also some work going on in terms of communication between this guy and their team. position 43. Information, noun 37, across there. Information,
  Interviewer: Information of the noun 42? Is this modulated by the position 41? Or just distributed?
  Participant: It’s likely to be modulated. They’re likely to have their own standard operating procedures.
  Interviewer: How do we want to label this differently than noun 42 to indicate that modulation?
  Participant: Along the lines of noun 42 conducted according to SOPs.
  Interviewer: And they’re sending Information, and they’re also sending noun 37? Which are just stuff?
  Participant: a lot of test work goes on in here. A lot of analysis goes on.
  Interviewer: Do you know or care about the instrumentation they use for analysis or verb 73? Or is it just a blackbox thing?
  Participant: We do care. In part, that’s covered in the noun 42. Is the question about: do we care about what sort of instrument they are using or the type of tests that they are doing?
  Interviewer: Both. Because. We can treat this as a black box. And stuff will flow from this black box to these. Or we can treat this as part of your understanding of the project, at which point we’re going to label their external manipulations of your noun 37 according to the SOP.
  Participant: I’ll explore one area. So these are physical noun 37. They actually have to manipulate those physical noun 37. They actually have to take and crush those noun 37 and prepare the physical noun 37. These are phsyical noun 37 from our noun 60... In order for the experimental team to do their experiments, they need to actually do some further ... and classification of the noun 37. The way they do that depends on the noun 42.
  Interviewer: So, is there an entity -- some technological device that is a useful catch-all or a useful...
  Participant: Let’s call it a properly sized Noun 21 noun 37
  Interviewer: So they’re sending properly sized Noun 21 noun 37?
  Participant: No. They recieve the physical noun 37, then they have to generate this properly sized Noun 21 noun 37. So they have to do some crushing and sizing.
  Interviewer: So this would be a noun 44? So this goes physical noun 37 in, and out comes properly sized and crushed... where does that go?
  Participant: It goes into an experimental noun 45. Crushed and sized Noun 21.
  Interviewer: Are there any stuff flows, Information, Data, going along this route?
  Participant: No, because it’s being done by this group.
  Interviewer: So they’re not setting any settings on the noun 44.
  Participant: Yes they are. That setting will be done to be consistent with the noun 42 that’s been provided.
  Interviewer: Are they setting the setting? Here’s the tricky bit. That setting of the setting, i.e. the transmission of the settings into the machine, is that Information or is that Data? Or is that something else?
  Participant: Well, it’s data from us, but it’s Information into this machine, isn’t it? We tell them -- this was Information... Information can be Data as well, right? You don’t want so say?
  Interviewer: The thing is, I can’t tell you what you think.
  Participant: The noun 42 has Data on the size distribution. So that’s a set size distribution. So that’s Data that we’ve provided the people so that they’re informed so as to how to set.
  Interviewer: So, in the Information of the noun 42, which is compiled of multiple protocols
  Participant: this is one of them
  Interviewer: This is one of them, and you would say this invididual protocol is Data? So in this packet of Information it goes through the position 41, the position 41 adds SOP, and that packet plus SOP is still Information. Do they perform something interesting to this packet to extract out -- or can it even be extracted out -- the settings for this noun 44?
  Participant: No, they just take Information and make the setting.
  Interviewer: So that would be transmitting information of size settings. -- Now, they’ve got an experimental noun 45. How are they interacting with the noun 45?
  Participant: They’re running the noun 45.
  Interviewer: Are they transmitting stuff to the noun 45? or is it
  Participant: Are they transmitting stuff?
  Interviewer: Are they transmitting components of the tech plan to the noun 45?
  Participant: No, because that’s what the SOP is about. The SOP guides them as to how they should run that noun 45.
  Interviewer: So there’s no data flow or Information flow into the noun 45.
  Participant: No.
  Interviewer: What happens from the noun 45?
  Participant: Produce new noun 37 of noun 46 which need to be analyzed. It goes to a Laboratory.
  Interviewer: And we’ve got new noun 37 of noun 46 to the lab: Who follow standard procedures as transmitted from him or them?
  Participant: Probably by him.
  Interviewer: So we’ve got SOP. And these SOP are Knowledge, Information...
  Participant: Also, according to the noun 42
  Interviewer: but it’s not that? Is it this flow?
  Participant: In the noun 42, there is Information as to what lab tests are to be done. It’s like that. You could take it out of there if you wanted to?
  Interviewer: What reflects reality best?
  Participant: The reality is that it probably... as well as SOP, it would be noun 42. In fact, it’s a bit similiar to what you’ve got there. noun 42 conducted...
  Interviewer: Is the noun 42 conducted also Information when it’s sent over here? So noun 42 conducted according to SOP goes to the lab along with noun 46 noun 37 which have been prepared through all that. What happens then?
  Participant: Then Data from the lab comes back through to this person here.
  Interviewer: So this is Data. What is this Data?
  Participant: The Data is the results of laboratory testing of noun 46 noun 37. I’m being Generic, if that helps you. I could be more specific about what exactly the Data is, -- I’m happy to do that.
  Interviewer: I would love an artifact... like a verb 73 of the results? But unless you think that it explains what you think Data is more, I don’t think we need to go into any more detail.
  Participant: I think the emphasis is that it is a result from the test.
  Interviewer: Because that’s the second time you’ve used Data in this, which is why it is significant.
  Participant: So this person prepares reports, and then the reports come back to the position 32.
  Interviewer: so you get reports on the results
  Participant: Correct. Via e-mail.
  Interviewer: is this significant?
  Participant: No.
  Interviewer: It’s interesting. Some people would say that e-mail is significant and that it actually changes the way the other people go --it’s e-mail. So reports on lab results. Is this Data Information Knowledge, other?
  Participant: At that point it’s Data. They are providing us Data. They haven’t made any -- Even in context of comparing other results, they would have compared Data from previous experiments that they’ve done with ours.
  Interviewer: And are these comparisons also Data, or are they priviledged in some way?
  Participant: I would have thought that would have been Information which they are not privy to declosing to us anyway. As far as I’m concerned... we get the Data back.
  Interviewer: Are there any other entities or steps we haven’t described?
  Participant: Here there’s another one. Then we have the discussion internally, with position 39. Obviously, we each, individually analyze  the data ourselves and then we do an excel spreadsheet analysis, if you want.
  Interviewer: Let’s stop there, let’s diagram that. How can we diagram that? We’ve got this line going to the position 39, what’s this first -- do you perform any operations on these reports before sending them to the position 39?
  Participant: I do. I will probably summarize key points in an excel spreadsheet. Differences between successive tests.
  Interviewer: What do we want to label that, and is that Data as well?
  Participant: It’s certainly data. “Results Analysis” Summary, I guess, of results analysis -- Results Summary. I guess I use the word Analysis there as well. ... and Analysis.
  Interviewer: Then what happens?
  Participant: Then we have our discussion.
  Interviewer: How can we represent this discussion? Should we represent this discussion?
  Participant: No. There’s all sorts of discussions going on elsewhere as well, but we haven’t presented that necessarily. You can leave it as that. And then, there’s a bit of recycle loop. This whole noun 97 then out of discussion are conclusions based on the current set of results and then we may well review the noun 42 and start this all again.
  Interviewer: So they send conclusions to you?
  Participant: No no.
  Interviewer: you all generate conclusions
  Participant: Yeah.
  Interviewer: How do we want to represent these conclusions, or do we? Or is that stream the conclusions, from the earlier iteration?
  Participant: Yeah, that’s fine. This was specific to the noun 42.
  Interviewer: So we add another stream going here...
  Participant: well, if you want, you can leave it as it is, then this discussion. The entity is that the position 39 -- the position 39 and myself get together -- therefore that stream ....
  Interviewer: so we have position 32 sends position 39 and position 32 a stream of Data which is results summary and analysis.
  Participant: Therefore, we can go from here with an updated noun 42. From then on we can follow the loop.
  Interviewer: And the updated noun 42 is?
  Participant: It’s Data, Sorry it’s Information. I mean, It is both, right? I’m providing data, but it’s primarily information.
  Interviewer: Unpack that for me.
  Participant: So I’m providing numbers. So the numbers, in isolation, mean virtually nothing. So attached to the data is some Information. Particularly in this feedback loop, I would present, we said we were going to crush the Noun 21s to this specification, but based on the current results, we’ll change it, so here’s a new setting which we still refer to as Information anyway.
  Interviewer: is that correct?
  Participant: I think so. In making that judgement, or in providing that Data, we are informing them of why we are changing the specifications, changing that Data.
  Interviewer: In a sense, this size setting is composed of numbers plus ... explanation?
  Participant: Almost Intellectual Property, some explanation.
  Interviewer: IP is a good word. We’ve got numbers plus IP. And you’d describe the numbers as?
  Participant: As the data.
  Interviewer: And you’d describe the IP as the Information. And that entire packet of data + Information, of numbers + IP, that entire packet is also Information.
  Interviewer: Where does Knowledge happen, is there any Knowledge transmission in this whole noun 97?
  Participant: Yeah. The Knowledge transmission probably takes place in this discussion.
  Interviewer: in the discussion of the position 39 and the position 32, what -- where’s the Knowledge interaction there?
  Participant: Where is it, or how does it...?
  Interviewer: All of the above.
  Participant: So it’s a meaning??? Data’s on the table. Information is exchanged: what do I know, what do you know? What does the Data, what do the results mean?
  Interviewer: And that meaning of results is... Information?
  Participant: The meaning of results is Information. But, that Information may be new. Or that’s an unexpected result. There is potential for Knowledge, for new Knowledge to be generated.
  Interviewer: And the new Knowledge which is generated comes from
  Participant: From the analysis of the results and the discussion of the results and the implications that are derived from the analysis of those results. Am I confusing you?
  Participant: Data, Information, and Knowledge. In my books, you analyze data. And generate new Information. New Information can generate a new... So, I have a model in my head, and this is what a noun 46 should be. And that model is Knowledge. That model could be shifted  slightly. A shift in some model (physical or whatever) is due to new Knowledge.
  Participant: Within that discussion
  Interviewer: we have that iteration. I need to figure out how to represent that iteration. In here we’ve got Knowledge being generated, does it go anywhere?
  Participant: For a start, it comes back -- the Knowledge is then transmitted back via information to these guys. We won’t provide that to them. There may be a little bit, but you’re not explicitly... It’s in the form of Information returned to the external organization via an external noun 42
  Interviewer: By them analyzing the updated noun 42 they see their own new Information, which means they can generate their own Knowledge?
  Participant: No, I don’t think they’d do that necessarily. The distinction here is these are research position 41... they’re an external service provider. If you have a contract for wanting you to do some work on your home for example, a plumber, you won’t necessarily tell them about what it is that you’re going to do with this device, you just tell them I want that fixed, and I want that service provided. and that’s whats happening here. We’re asking them to perform tests and asking them to provide us Data. We’ll assess the data, there’s no interaction with the position 43. They’re just providing that service.
  Interviewer: Therefore do you sink your Knowledge somewhere else here so that other people can take it?
  Participant: Yes.
  Interviewer: So let’s name that.
  Participant: We’ve named these position 39 but we could probably name them more specifically as position 47 because over here because the next offshoot here, the other entity is the position 48.
  Interviewer: You, to them, send...
  Participant: Information. We provide them with Information, but they might ask for explanation as well, so therefore we give them Knowledge.
  Interviewer: First step is you’re sending them Information. You’re sending them what Information?
  Participant: It will be something -- a summary of the summary that has just been produced. It could be a presentation. Executive summary if you want.
  Participant: now, I put in this category, generally speaking what happens is when you get to this point you will have different levels within the organziation. For example, you might have a general position 41 of the operations, a position 41 of the operations, and then a... So what  we refer to as level 4, level 3 and level 2 position 41s. Let’s call them position 41s for a moment, I’ve clumped them all together under position 49.
  Interviewer: So you send to these level 4,3,2 position 41s...
  Participant: We would probably send them Information first.The alternative ... we may send them Information. More than likely we’ll sit down with them and present the Information.
  Interviewer: So there’s some communication of Information, and then what?
  Participant: Then that Information is discussed in a meeting, not that meeting, with these guys. And decisions are made as a result. The decision might be to continue the noun 35, continue the noun 42
  b; So they send back to you ...
  Participant: Remember I said we’d probably do it as a meeting
  Interviewer: so this meeting sends back to you...
  Participant: In here position 49 + position 47
  Interviewer: and this dovetailed flow goes back to?
  Participant: Ourselves.
  Interviewer: And this dovetailed flow is the recommendations?
  Participant: Recommendations, yeah.
  Interviewer: And these recommendations are?
  Participant: Recommendations of Information via definition...
  Interviewer: So these recommendations are information. Do you transmit Knowledge from this meeting -- the position 47 and yourself to the position 49? How can we render this Knowledge transfer? So you’re sending Knowledge...
  Participant: It’s that IP. It’s like this. You say here is new Information, here is what we interpret as the new Knowledge, we’re providing that new Knowledge.
  Interviewer: So we could say that this is the IP... What do they do with the executive summary plus IP besides send back recommendations to you regarding the experiment?
  Participant: So these guys in this project would then -- these are position 49 people, they would communicate that Information, these people may well be in the same meeting, by the way, but let’s assume they’re not, to noun 51 department.
  Participant: Because what this is about is the purchasing of alternate Noun 21 noun 51.
  Interviewer: so position 49 are sending Information
  Participant: Information? So this would be a recommendation to verb 52 another Noun 21. It is Information. And these guys would then talk  to by phone or whatever, transmit in some way, that information to the Noun 21 noun 51ers. verb 52 and negotiate noun 53 and that sort of thing.
  Interviewer: and that’s just an Information flow? What do they do?
  Participant: They will send stuff back.
  Interviewer: Do you care about the stuff they send back?
  Participant: Yes, we do. They will send specifications back to these guys here.
  Interviewer: And these specifications?
  Participant: Noun 21 specifications
  Interviewer: and these Noun 21 specifications are?
  Participant: Data.
  Interviewer: And the noun 51 department then
  Participant: Then they would provide that noun 51 to the position 49
  Interviewer: Are they modulating this or are they just passing it on?
  Participant: They’re just passing it on. And that’s where it sits, because these are the guys that actually...
  Interviewer: What else? Are there any other flows in this noun 97?
  Participant: There are only other flows over here, but they’re outside... Probably there is, but that looks pretty good for me.
  ...
  Interviewer: This diagram is your how does one turn into the other, which means that you’re stating that one can turn into the other. Which is important because not everyone believes that.
  Participant: Mind you, having gone through that, I was thinking all along: this is no different to any other activity you might end up doing anyway. The fact is that there is an position 43, but in the end it could be anybody.
  Interviewer: It’s just someone who applies the SOP. they’re a clearinghouse.
  ...
  Interviewer: Let’s spend this time chatting about your philosophies of Data, Information, and Knowledge. Let’s begin by going: “Can you give me your own definition of these three terms?”
  Participant: Of Data? I guess I was sort of doing it here, in a way. It’s what you do the Data... What is Data there? Data in itself, if you look at numbers on a sheet of paper, multidimensional, these are numbers in this case. An example using just numbers. Looking at that assemblage of Data points, it’s hard to come up with some mental model. Particularly if it’s multifactorial.
  Interviewer: So one of these is a data point?
  Participant: All of them are
  Interviewer: Each of them is a data point and collectively they are data?
  Participant: Yeah. But it’s the interpretation of the data which is required. That can be done by your own mind, but it can be done in a more systematic way: steadfastly, there is tools. You have excel tools, excel software. You have other statistical analysis tools.
  Interviewer: So data + analysis through tools creates Information?
  Participant: Creates Information, yeah. Ultimately, where this is going to end up is, I’ve got a model in my head: this causes that, for example. I’m looking at the Data and I’m analyzing the Data, and I want to understand whether the Data indicates that that is true or not. That there is a cause and an effect, that there is is a...
  Interviewer: So the Data is informing Knowledge of causal relationships in your model?
  Participant: Yeah. One of these may be a dependant variable, and the rest might be independent variables. I’m trying to understand if these dependencies are there?
  Interviewer: And this understanding is Knowledge?
  Participant: That’s part of the Knowledge, yes.
  Interviewer: And so we’ve got analysis... and so the analyzed Information in this... Where does Information fall in this causal... ?
  Participant: The Information is almost an extraction ... Data + analysis provides Information. and Information then can be used to generate new Knowledge.
  Interviewer: Information + what? Is there a plus?
  Participant: Well, I was talking about models here, so Information + model....
  Interviewer: And a model is?
  Participant: A model could be anything. It could be an equation, it could be a physical model.
  Interviewer: and the class the model falls in is Information or is it Knowledge?
  Participant: It’s probably old Knowledge in this definition.
  Interviewer: And so, in this definition, Information which is the combined Data + analysis of these data points, which are numbers.
  Participant: They could be numbers they could be... You could also.... Data + analysis, but over here it could be Contextual Information. There may be things around... you could have a set of data, two sets of data, and the difference between those two sets of data is the constraints  that were imposed by group 130 or by some other entity, and that’s the explanation. Data is first, then constraints, analysis, and so on.
  Interviewer: And these constraints and this analysis are? Analysis is really a verb. These constraints and analysis are data?
  Participant: No, constraints they’re... other data. I jumped to that because you were talking about the data points. So that’s just the data points. The constraints are, you’ve got this objective function, there are relationships that define X = Y, help to define that. But then bounding that are constraints. Maybe a way of thinking about it is: if you’re trying to optimize production rates or something like that, you could say OK, production rate = A+BC, but you know that C is bounded by something else, by Data. Therefore, it isn’t just the data, it’s Data + Constraints.
  Interviewer: And these constraints are other data. You mentioned a very important word to me: relationships. Relationships are?
  Participant: A relationship may such as that?
  Interviewer: So this function is a relationship?
  Participant: We call it ... you’re distinguishing mathematically now?
  Interviewer: What I’m trying to get at: do you classify a relationship as Data, Information, or Knowledge?
  Participant: I think a relationship, like that, is probably Knowledge.
  Interviewer: And that would be the model, basically.
  Participant: Yes.
  Interviewer: you mentioned context?
  Participant: So the context is that you could have a relationship like that unbounded, but the context is that’s knowing what the constraints are.
  Interviewer: So context is the application of constraints.
  Participant: Constraints, yeah. That’s certainly one way to interpret context in this example.
  Interviewer: This application of constraints as context is also Knowledge? Or is it...
  Participant: The application of constraints? I think that’s probably Information. It’s either Data or Information. It’s not Knowledge.
  Interviewer: Can we have arrows going the other direction here? We have this new Knowledge from this analysis noun 97. What happens then?
  Participant: What happens back this way? New Knowledge is always, or should be, communicated and then -- on the practical side of it is: communicated, argued, and then agreed or discarded.
  Interviewer: So you’ve got the Knowledge which is bound into or discarded from your knowledge-of-world, since we can’t have impressive  German terms.... At some point in this chain, you issue normative orders: “You should do this.” Those normative orders, here, are function of your noun 42?
  Participant: They’re represented by the noun 42, and they’re represented by that Information.
  Interviewer: Your classification of these orders, these “You should do something” is it part of this model, or is it part of a different model?
  Participant: I see what you’re getting back to this... which is a flat... I think it’s, in practice, I think it’s seperate. particularly in practice --
  Participant: Let’s say we’ve got scientific or technical Knowledge. And think of it back over here, it’s sort of like technical Knowledge is sort of in here.
  Interviewer: Technical Knowledge is where?
  Participant: See, you have learnt new things. Sorry, these are results plus summary and analysis. You’re generating, performing
  Interviewer: You’re performing the data + analysis into Information into Knowledge.
  Participant: So, now, it’s expressed here as IP. I guess in that case it is coming back up, it’s Information. So, in effeect, we described it as Information.
  Interviewer: We’ve described that Knowledge generation noun 97...
  Participant: has provided new Information to be provided to the noun 60 position 90s.
  Interviewer: and they can then take that information and put it into their own cycle?
  Participant: Yeah. They can. In fact I’m sure it happens like that, too. The reason I’m ??? is that there’s probably a filter here before it gets to noun 60 position 90s.
  Interviewer: So we’ve got Technical Knowledge, and this Technical Knowledge is this IP? No.
  Participant: It’s that IP. Put through a filter, so that these people will understand better.
  Interviewer: This filter is?
  Participant: What it is is the executive summary. What becomes is -- that’s the executive summary what it is over here a detailed summary, if you want, but it’s more than that.
  Interviewer: Detailed summary and stuff. And then it’s winnowed into this executive summary.
  Participant: It’s sort of like the questions you want -- you’ll have some questions in your mind that these people will want answered. so they’ve got objectives: do I, or don’t I change Noun 21 noun 51? That’s the question. You’re anticipating that question, so therefore you generate  a summary of or a distillation of this detailed stuff to present to them to address that.
  Interviewer: that distillation is?
  Participant: Is -- over here we’ve got information. And we’ve said IP, in part. but over here the distillation is the application of -- no, it’s quite separate. So you’ve got new Knowledge, which is then put through a filter which is -- its nothing to do with the technical. it’s more about, let’s call it, a social. It’s non-technical. It’s about how to explain to you what I know? So I will try to put it into ... I’ll try to work out what you’re likely to understand, so I’m thinking: “Well, he’s not a social scientist, he’s a IST person, so therefore he’ll understand some noun 109. So I’ll put some maths or a relationship there. But if you were a salesperson with a marketing degree, probably forget about that.” The filter is a verb 112 of -- it’s a device that permits more effective transmission of information between one entity and another. And in this case it’s probably a filter around “What will that person understand?”
  Interviewer: I think one way of talking about that filter is a local language. That we evolve that we know, that when we’re speaking to each other that we have these specific terms that are locally true but not globally true.
  Participant: It’s certainly jargon, if you want to put it that way. It’s more than that, it’s... the way that Information can be communicated is based on level of people. Meaning time, availability. But it’s also, what I was saying earlier, about Knowledge.
  Interviewer: The Knowledge of the listener?
  Participant: Of the listener. And their level, and Knowledge of the listener which includes their understanding level. The other aspect is just they usually. It’s synthesis. It’s the synthesising of all the Information. It’s the bottom line. If this, this, and this, are all true, what does it mean? What’s the bottom line? It’s being able to: that executive summary is being able to go that plus that plus that to get to the bottom line. This is the ultimate result. The ultimate piece of information that they require.
  Interviewer: And that executive summary, as Information, is functionally a normative recommendation to change Noun 21 noun 51ers or not to change Noun 21 noun 51ers.
  Participant: Yeah, it’s a recommendation as opposed to a decision.
  Interviewer: That distinction is important.
  Participant: This doesn’t necessarily provide -- that’s Knowledge, because it’s the IP, but the executive summary is Information via recommendation. But that’s really a decision.
  Interviewer: And that decision is an order to change or nothing’s sent.
  Participant: That’s right.
  Interviewer: and you would say that this decision is Information in the same style that the executive sumamry is Information or the noun 42 is Information. Or is the difference sort of Information?
  Participant: Well, the decision is almost really Data? In a way. It’s Information, but it’s also ... no, it’s Information. I was thinking whether or not it was Data. you’re just saying, it’s yes or no. In that context “Do I or don’t I?” and you’re saying “Do”, to the noun 51 person. It’s 1, go.
  Interviewer: And that Boolean decision is still Information?
  Participant: I think that’s Data, that’s what I’m saying.
  Interviewer: Perhaps this decision ...
  Participant: It’s informing the person to do something like the noun 51er to do it
  Interviewer: It’s a container for Data? So, perhaps you’ve got the D: 1/0 change, don’t change. But it’s transmitted in some sort of information?
  Participant: Yes, yeah. It’s yes or no, but behind the yes or no is this other Information. It’s what is supporting the yes or the no. What Information is supporting that decision. A yes or a no.
  Interviewer: In this other context, In order to undertake something new , say you’re ordering someone to go do that research. An order is an example or instance of what?
  Participant: An order is -- you’ve made a decision
  Interviewer: and you’re transmitting that decision to me as the orderee. And that transmission of decision is? Is it on this line?
  Participant: The transmission of the decision is there. It’s Data.
  Interviewer: Because it boils down to a 1 or a 0?
  Participant: Yeah.
  Interviewer: If you told me, Brian, go research that new IST system for CRM, that is also Data?
  Participant: Yeah.
  Interviewer: The go research component is? Constraint?
  Participant: Yeah. It’s probably Information. You’re saying context of... It has to be Information, surely.
  Interviewer: You have a pretty good sense of what I’m trying to tease out now. Do you have any parting words on ... conclusions I should come to in this analysis that might not be ovbious from the diagrms
  Participant: I’m not sure... I think the discussion about Data which is what you said there anyway, the Data, Information, Knowledge it’s quite confronting in a way for me, because I ... but I think it’s worthwhile for you to persue it. You’ve probably held back your own views about what is and what isn’t data. And what is and what isn’t Information. I’d - I’m not sure. They are distinct. To a degree. At times, they will overlap.  I think what I’ve been struggling with, through this interview if you want, is how to seperate them. To make them more distinct. But maybe there isn’t a need for that. Maybe there are different flows here that are both Information and Data, and both Information and Knowledge.
  Interviewer: Thank you for this time.
  Participant: It was a pleasure, and I say that sincerely, actually. What I do appreciate is being challenged. Not necessarily by Brian, but what he was trying to do.</delimited>                                                                                                                                                                                                                       <section detail='section' location='aut:169'>                                                                                                                                                                                                                       <sectionnumber>7.8</sectionnumber>                                                                                                                                                                                                                         <sectiontitle>Interview 8</sectiontitle>                                                                                                                                                                                                                         <sectioncontent> <delimited detail='extract'>Interviewer: Let us do the training. Because we’re short on time, I’m going to skip making an entity dictionary. Functionally, an entity is any person or thing or noun 97 that can manipulate Data, Information, and Knowledge in some interesting way. You, yourself, can be multiple entities depending on what your role is. When I’m at university for example, I can have the role of noun 91 researcher, but I can also have the role of Teaching Assistant. And they’re different. My computer doesn’t necessarily have a role. If it’s acting like the pen in my hand, I don’t think about the pen I’m using, I just write. But if I suddenly, go “wait a minute, no, the pen is important because it’s doing some sort of transformation of what I’m doing, then suddenly it’s an entity.” We’ll start with you diagramming a role that you play in this noun 97. And then we’ll go from there to just a trivial flow of Data, Information, or Knowledge, and just build out. What would be a simple role that you play?
  Participant: One is, of course, if you count the training, One would be putting together the material.
  Interviewer: What could we label that role as?
  Participant: I suppose its ... author? I’m lecturing.
  Interviewer: We can call it author. Perhaps lecture author?
  Participant: Everyone that has some training, they don’t go and get a book. We should sometimes, it would be a lot easier and take less time. It seems like everyone, every time there’s some training going on you start thinking about ‘what are we supposed to be telling them?’ what subject? What do I feel is important from a theoretical view? And also what’s important to the noun 60? You have to look at both sides. From that I produce a lecturing material.
  Interviewer: Let’s model that. So we’ve got Lecture Author... now, you as Lecture Author, you tell me that you’re producing lecture material. Let’s start with ...
  Participant: I usually base -- I use Data a lot. Because I start with a theory and then I actually use noun 60 Data -- that theory is not just something I came up with...
 Interviewer: Where do you get Data from?
  Participant: From different production DBs so they’re collecting --
  Interviewer: Production DBs? So we’ll call ... production...
  Participant: You’re sort of really looking at numbers.
  Interviewer: Are we looking at numbers?
  Participant: No, we’re also looking at relationships between Data. Which in the thoretical case would be coming from books. Fundamental chemistry, I suppose. Characteristics.
  Interviewer: So we’ve got the production DB and we’ve got books. What do you communicate to the production DB to get Data back? Or do you?
  Participant: I just do the ordinary thing. I just use our tools to extract our Data. Manually we sort of -- that’s what we have to do all the time. We don’t have any kind of simple statistics. We normally don’t have any problems. We just have them SQL script, and just extract with whatever tools our IST department noun 51. And it could be different programs for different DBs, because in a noun 60, we have sort of a mix of different types of DBs from old to new and depending on system levels too. We normally work with 3 levels. One planning level, noun 88, and we certainly have the level 1 which is the noun 60 sort of system, whatever that controlls the noun 60. Level 1, and 2 is more ... calculation. And 3 is the planning. So you might get Data from all of them. And they all have different DBs.
  Interviewer: Should we generalize your request to those DBs? Is it possible to put one request to any of those databases under one heading?
  Participant: Yes, I suppose it is. We call that fact-finding or something. I wouldn’t sort of treat them differently. Because they’re sort of just numbers anyways.
  Interviewer: This flow of fact-finding to the DBs, is it Data, Information, Knowledge or other?
  Participant: It’s just Data, numbers, from measurements.
  Interviewer: So you, to the DBs, are sending Data?
  Participant: No, I’m collecting Data. The equipment is...
  Interviewer: We’ve got a flow from you to the DBs of Fact finding. What is that flow? Is it Data, Is it Information, is it Knowledge, or is it smething else?
  Participant: I’d just ask...
  Interviewer: So you asking to retrieve -- are you sending the computers, Data, Information, Knowledge, or something else? Or nothing?
  Participant: Or nothing. no, no, I just ask for -- I want a list of numbers.
  Interviewer: So that statement of list, you don’t categorize as Data, Information, or Knowledge?
  Participant: No, I haven’t. But I suppose it is Knowledge, because I put together the question encoded to my Knowledge. I would be sending that Knowledge, even if the DB doesn’t acknowledge it.
  Interviewer: You are sending it Knowledge because it’s a representation of your Knowledge?
  Participant: Yeah. I choose, I suppose, And expand beyond that, to extract the Data, think on a little bit more would be someone else doing the same job might extract some other Data
  Interviewer: because they don’t have the same Knowledge?
  Participant: Yeah.
  Interviewer: Now, you send a Knowledge flow of fact-finding to the DBs. What do you get back?
  Participant: I would get back numbers, I suppose? Again the facts. Hopefully the facts and not fiction. I wouldn’t know. I have to examine the Data. And that’s sort of -- when I retrieve the Data, you go through the Data, and you sort of quality control, I would think. Based on my Knowledge. That’s no fun. The scrutiny of Data.
  Interviewer: Let’s set that aside for a second. You get back from the production DB Data, yes? It’s not Information or Knowledge, right?
  Participant: No, it’s just Data.
  Interviewer: The Data you get back, just like you’re sending fact-finding flow. What do you call a flow you get back from a DB?
  Participant: I suppose it’s some Knowledge too, I suppose. Or results or ... It would be results. It’s the result of something.
  Interviewer: Of your fact-finding
  Participant: Yeah.
  Interviewer: This is what we’re looking at. You as your lecture author, send fact-finding Knowledge flow to the production DB. They respond with a Data flow of results.
  Participant: Yep.
  Interviewer: Now you mentioned books. How can we build something like that to books?
  Participant: The books would have a big part in the fact finding. In what Knowledge I would sort of send...
  Interviewer: The first question is, if we’re treating a set of books as an entity, is there a flow from you to the books?
  Participant: At this point, I couldn’t think of one. No, I wouldn’t be able to tell the books anything.
  Interviewer: Would you consider the selection of a particular book from a set of books a sense of communication from you to the entity. Or is it just access which isn’t communication?
  Participant: It’s just access.
  Interviewer: From the books to you, however, is there a flow?
  Participant: Of Knowledge. A Knowledge flow.
  Interviewer: so there’s a Knowledge flow. This Knowledge flow, what can we label?
  Participant: Theories. And I suppose Theories and experiences. Depending on what...
  Interviewer: so the books can provide a Knowledge flow of experiences?
  Participant: Yeah.
  Interviewer: Is it separate from the Knowledge flow of theories?
  Participant: No, it would be probably one. I think books would be either/or. If it’s not something published where somebody did investigation. But if you look at printed books, they’re either theories or both. Even in the books, they would use sometimes examples based on production data.
  Interviewer: You as lecture author use books and the production database to generate your lecture. Do you use anything else to generate your lecture?
  Participant: It would be more illustrations.
  Interviewer: Where do you get the illustrations from?
  Participant: It could be drawings... or if its equipment, that would be from our noun 89.
  Interviewer: What entity should we label it as, noun 89?
  Participant: Yeah.
  Interviewer: now this noun 89, do you send it anything as part of this noun 97?
  Participant: Not more than a request for a certain drawing. I just usually go to someone who has to print out the... I would ask...
  Interviewer: What do you do? You ask the archive...
  Participant: for a particular text.
  Interviewer: how can we label this flow?
  Participant: Drawing Request.
  Interviewer: This drawing request, is it Data, Information, Knowledge, or other?
  Participant: Other, I suppose. Or it’s the same with the Data. We’ll ask for something specific because of what I want -- I suppose it’s a little bit of Knowledge in that. It’s based on what I want to show so it might just be -- I would relay when my word?? comes back, it’s more like Information.
  Interviewer: So you send a drawing request, which is an expression of expertise? i.e. Knowledge? Or is it something else?
  Participant: Somethign else. I mean, I don’t know anything about it.
  Interviewer: you just say I want such and such.
  Participant: Because I want just show something practical or have need or practical use of it together with some other data or some event or whatever.
  Interviewer: So that request, if we’re putting it in the other category, I need to label it something. What would you label it as, category wise?
  Participant: So you have Knowledge,
  Interviewer: Information, and Data.
  Participant: I think I’m sending it Knowledge, I suppose, because I know something. I have Knowledge about something, that’s why I need this particular drawing.
  Interviewer: Because you have Knowledge, you’re sending that Knowledge to them?
  Participant: I never thought I was sending something more than the request for Information. Or get back, it’s just -- that’s a little bit harder.
  Interviewer: Let’s have the flow back, what’s the flow back from the drawings?
  Participant: That’s Information, yeah.
  Interviewer: Now, what is this Information? What is the drawing archive sending you as Information?
  Participant: what would you call a drawing?
  Interviewer: You said illustration earlier. Would it be illustrations, would it be something else?
  Participant: It would be a scaled drawing of some equipment.
  Interviewer: And this drawing is Information?
  Participant: Yeah.
  Interviewer: But the drawing request is not Information?
  Participant: No, I suppose it would be...
  Interviewer: I’m not trying to put words in your mouth. Don’t use the exclusion... don’t go: “Well, it’s not Data, and it’s not Knowledge, so it has to be Information”
  Participant: Of course I have a reason why I want this particular...
  Interviewer: But you’re not communicating this reason, are you?
  Participant: No. You go to the computer “I want this drawing. and send it to this printer.”
  Interviewer: Is that meta-data, is that communication?
  Participant: I suppose I’m sending it Data, because I’m just punching in a few numbers.
  Interviewer: That’s different from the fact-finding Knowledge, yes?
  Participant: Yeah.
  Interviewer: So you are sending the noun 89 Data, because the drawing request is Data.
  Participant: Yeah, that’s right.
  Interviewer: But you get back Information as the drawing.
  Participant: Yeah.
  Interviewer: You then take results from the production database, theories and experiences from books, and drawings from the noun 89 and what do you do with them?
  Participant: I produce the material.
  Interviewer: Now, what do you do with that material?
  Participant: I would produce sort of lecture materials which I would -- would give us communicate with the position 90.
  Interviewer: Who would the lecture materials go to in terms of roles?
  Participant: It goes to me as the lecturerer.
  Interviewer: so the lecture author sends to the lecturer lecture material.
  Participant: Yes.
  Interviewer: This lecture material, is this Data, Information, or Knowledge?
  Participant: I would say all three.
  Interviewer: So this is Data and Information and Knowledge.
  Participant: I would say that it’s Information and Data.
  Interviewer: It’s Knowledge?
  Participant: It’s Knowledge. I suppose it makes up your Knowledge if you say Knowledge is based on Information and Data.
  Interviewer: Is it?
  Participant: Knowledge... you learn from something. Experiences which can be either a specific experience Knowledge... but. Because if you’re just sending Data, and the reciever is the person who has to come up with the -- make up the Knowledge part.
  Interviewer: So the author is sending Data, Information, and Knowledge to the lecturer.
  Participant: That’s the material container.
  Interviewer: Does the author send anything else to the lecturer?
  Participant: Not that I can think of.
  Interviewer: Now, what does the lecturer do with that lecture material?
  Participant: Communicate to the recievers. Now it’s the case of position 90s, or the class.
  Interviewer: Lecturer sends to the position 90s, what?
  Participant: I would say mainly the Knowledge part. That’s the big thing. That’s the purpose.
  Interviewer: So the lecturer sends to the position 90s Knowledge of, what can we label this?
  Participant: It’s Technical Knowledge.
  Interviewer: Since we have 4 minutes left, let’s do a very brief theory session. What is Data?
  Participant: For me? It’s Information. It’s some kind of recorded readings, values of ??? discontinuous or continuous flow of events.
  Interviewer: Now you mentioned the term Information. Can you define Data again for me?
  Participant: Information I suppose... is a measure of the Data, as opposed to the measurable property.
  Interviewer: So Data is a measure of a property?
  Participant: Yeah, for me.
  Interviewer: What is Information?
  Participant: Information for me, would be more of the numbers.... but more sort of verbal text. For me, Information is text, and Data is this numbers. But even a text could be Data.
  Interviewer: How is text Data?
  Participant: Because sometimes text could describe a measure better than a number, I think. Depending on what you want to use it for.
  Interviewer: so a measure of a property can be either qualitative or quantitative. Whereas Information is what?
  Participant: I would say it’s a quality, I think. Information, I suppose, can mix with all Data, Knowledge. Something that you relate -- it goes from one source to another. Any kind of Data or Knowledge is some kind of Information.
  Interviewer: So would you say Information is a container for Data and Knowledge? Some sort of communicative thing?
  Participant: Yeah, I would think. Or, ??? when you’re just looking at numbers... Information I suppose is a continouus flow of Data and numbers and Knowledge sort of ...
  Interviewer: Okay. What’s Knowledge?
  Participant: That’s harder. Knowledge could be your perception of something. If that’s what you think you know, anyways.
  Interviewer: Knowledge is what you think you know?
  Participant: For me, yeah. But I suppose someone has some other Knowledge which I could sort of receive too, and then it becomes my Knowledge.
  Interviewer: How can someone give you Knowledge? Do they just give you Knowledge, or do they give you Knowledge through something else?
  Participant: You can recieve Knowledge, I suppose. Text, verbally, visual.
  Interviewer: But the flow would still be a Knowledge flow, it wouldn’t be a Data flow or an Information flow?
  Participant: It could be all. You can find Knowledge in ... you could get direct Knowledge as sort of verbal, but you can also recieve Data but then you sort of have to compute the Data for it to become Knowledge. I think the Data itself does not become Knowledge until you do something with the Data.
  Interviewer: What about Information?
  Participant: It’s the same, I think. You still have to do something. You have to put it in perspective.
  Interviewer: Three very quick questions. First, is Data atomic, can you divide data? Is there something that’s more... fundamental than Data?
  Participant: Not that I can think of.
  Interviewer: Is there something above Knowledge? Is there something that combines Knowledge into something bigger than itself?
  Participant: That’s a religious question.
  Interviewer: Yes, it can be.
  Participant: I wouldn’t be able to describe it. I sometimes think that there’s something even above Knowledge.
  Interviewer: But we don’t have a ...
  Participant: No.
  Interviewer: When someone tells you to do something: “You should do this” are they communicating Data, Information, Knowledge, or something else to you?
  Participant: I think they’re giving me Information, I would think. Instruction is ... that comes with a consequence. If I have to do something. I think they’re sending me Information, I would think. Which I would probably transform into some kind of Knowledge. Of what the consequences would be if I don’t go along with the Informational instruction.
  Interviewer: If you’re making predictive statements about the future, or from the past to the present, are those predictive statements, Data, Information, or Knowledge? And what are you using to create them?
  Participant: It would be Knowledge. And I would be using Information and Data to produce these Knowledge.
  Interviewer: How does experience turn into predictions?
  Participant: Intuition.
  Interviewer: You’d say experience is Knowledge?
  Participant: It’s not perhaps, it’s part of the Knowledge.
  Interviewer: and you’d say that causal models are part of Knowledge? Like if I’ve got these inputs, this output would happen?
  Participant: Yeah, sort of, predictive models ... they would be Knowledge, yeah.</delimited>                                                                                                                                                                                                                         <float detail='figure' reference='fig:i2' location='aut:170'>                                                                                                                                                                                                                           <floatcontent><image name='i8.pdf' path='Chapter4/graphs'/></floatcontent>                                                                                                                                                                                                                           <floatcaption>                                                                                                                                                                                                                             <floattag>Figure 7.11:</floattag>                                                                                                                                                                                                                               <floattext>The SDFN Diagram for Interview 8</floattext>                                                                                                                                                                                                                           </floatcaption>                                                                                                                                                                                                                         </float>                                                                                                                                                                                                                            <section detail='section' location='aut:171'>                                                                                                                                                                                                                           <sectionnumber>7.9</sectionnumber>                                                                                                                                                                                                                             <sectiontitle>Interview 9</sectiontitle>                                                                                                                                                                                                                             <sectioncontent> <delimited detail='extract'>Interviewer: Let’s model both topics.
  Participant: Do we have time?
  Interviewer: No, but I want to model both. Let’s do the noun 91 first.
  Participant: it’s probably more relevant to this particular group. In that there was very little interaction from the reline in terms of work that I did.
  Interviewer: I’m going to skip the entity dictionary. Normally what I do with people is: let’s just go through and figure out what entities there are. What I’m going to do instead is describe to you what an entity could be, and we’ll just jump in because I’d love to get both. An entity is a role that someone or something plays. Tools can be entities if they’re not ready to hand. A pen isn’t an entity because when I’m writing, I don’t go “pen.” But, SAS is probably an entity because I’ll be doing lexical analysis through it. If it’s providing a transformation, it’s an entity. You, yourself, can have multiple entities. As a noun 91 student, I’ve got position 56 hat, I’ve got teaching assistant hat, I’ve got grader hat, I’ve got database position 31 hat. Just because I’m one person doesn’t meant I’m one entity. So, starting with the noun 91.
  ...
  Interviewer: This is looking at both your noun 91 methodology and the noun 91 noun 97. The surrounding... We’ll start by modeling a trivial noun 97 in your noun 91. because it’s best to start slow. Which entity would you like to characterize yourself as first?
  Participant: Me?
  Interviewer: You as?
  Participant: I guess as a position 56? The one doing the work.
  Interviewer: As a position 56. You’ve got flows of stuff. I use the word stuff because I’m not going to day Data, Information, or Knowledge. Or other. To someone else. What is a trivial flow of stuff to someone else and who is that other person?
  Participant: I guess the trivial stuff would be reporting: talking about progress, results. So my main position 92s here are [name] and [name].
 ...
  Interviewer: So, position 56 to position 92s. What are you sending them?
  Participant: I’m sending them Information. I meet with them about once a week to talk about what I’ve done. It might be results that I’ve gotten, that I can show them. It might just be talking about how things are going.
  Interviewer: Do we want to differentiate that? This diagram is atemporal. Everything is superimposed because dealing with reality is such a pain. Let’s break that down into multiple flows. You’re telling them what you’ve done.
  Participant: yeah.
  Interviewer: Do we have a better label than “what you’ve done?”
  Participant: Progress?
  Interviewer: Now, you send them a flow of stuff about progress. Now this flow of stuff could just be a conversation, but it’s still a transfer of... stuff. The stuff you identified is Information?
  Participant: As in results?
  Interviewer: Your progress update. Is your progress update Data, Information, Knowledge, or other?
  Participant: Information?
  Interviewer: You may also send them Results. These results are?
  Participant: Data.
  Interviewer: Do you send them anything else in these usual meetings?
  Participant: What about concerns? Can you send concerns? Emotions? Frustration?
  Interviewer: Do you want to summarize them as one flow?
  Participant: Concerns, I guess, is the right one.
  Interviewer: These concerns that we all have are what?
  Participant: Well they’re not Data. They’re not really Knowledge. So I’m assuming they’re Information.
  Interviewer: Don’t use exclusions.
  Participant: Can they be emotion?
  Interviewer: Sure. Is the communication of emotions a unique concept? Or is covered under the other categories? Is emotion distinct in itself or is it part of some larger superset?
  Participant: I would have thought that it would be distinct in itself. ... I’m going to think that emotions are separate. [someone else] probably wouldn’t look at that.
  Interviewer: This is a really useful interview.
  Participant: Because it’s true! I’m a lot more emotional than a lot of the [group] are. And so, for me, communicating emotions and getting feedback and getting my emotions right is important for me...
  Interviewer: And this is distinct from Data, Information, and Knowledge?
  Participant: yeah.
  Interviewer: Do you send them anything else?
  Participant: No, I think that covers my part.
  Interviewer: What do they send you?
  Participant: I’d probably break it down into feedback and guidance.
  Interviewer: Feedback is?
  Participant: It’s Information. Yeah, I’d put that one as Information. That’s responding to what I’ve done and telling me how they think things are going. Whereas guidance is probably more Knowledge, because that’s more pushing me in certain directions or giving me the understanding that I need in order to progress in different directions.
  Interviewer: What you’re identifying here are normative statements: “You should do this.” I’ll want to unpack those later. So, your position 92 sends back feedback and guidance. Do they send anything else?
  Participant: Occasionally they’ll send -- there’s a problem where I’ve done something and it hasn’t given the results we expected. And so [name’s] done the work himself and then provided results back for me to compare to.
  Interviewer: So these are comparative results?
  Participant: yeah. They’d be Data.
  Interviewer: Who/what else do you work with? Do you get or send flows to as a position 56?
  Participant: My other position 92 who is my [location] position 92. Because he’s kind of separate. Because I don’t talk to him that often.
  Interviewer: adjective 93 position 92? or ignored position 92?
  Participant: Hey, it goes both ways.
  Interviewer: You to your adjective 93 position 92 send what?
  Participant: The main thing would be progress, than anything.
  Interviewer: as Information?
  Participant: Yes.
  Interviewer: Is it the same progress?
  Participant: More condensed. So it’s not the same progress. I’ll talk to him every few months or so and I’ll talk to them every week.
  Interviewer: Condensed you would say?
  Participant: Maybe summary.
  Interviewer: Summary of progress is?
  Participant: Information.
  Interviewer: Does he send anything back?
  Participant: ...
  Interviewer: Sorry, in the best of all possible worlds, does he send anything back?
  Participant: Occasionally?
  Interviewer: What does he send back?
  Participant: Occasionally he sends back guidance, Knowledge.
  Interviewer: Is it the same guidance?
  Participant: No, different Knowledge.
  Interviewer: How can we differentiate these guidances?
  Participant: I don’t know. Direction?
  Interviewer: Tell me this guidance versus this guidance. They send you what?
  Participant: They [local position 92s] send me kind of week to week guidance. At the moment I’ve been developing a ... model to try and describe [undesired chemical interaction]. And so I’ve developed something to counteract that. So, over the noun 97 of developing that, [name] has kind of given me direction in terms of: “Oh, should we consider this model instead?” and I’ll try that and it won’t work. And I’ll say OK, that one didn’t work, what about this. And point me in different directions. and then I’ll do the work and come back and say none of the work serves what I’ve done, which is what happens. Whereas with my adjective 93 position 92 it’s more of, I’ll present him a summary of what I’ve worked on for the last 2-3 months and say “This is where I’m planning to go.” More of the higher up position 92 than a day to day thing. And I’ll kind of talk more about this is my plan for where I’m heading based on what I’ve done. And he’ll provide kind of direction and, if necessary, Information on different things I’m planning on doing.
  Interviewer: So this directed guidance, as Knowledge, so he provides ...
  Participant: when I say Information, I mean papers, or contacts, or things like that. And that kind of stuff I would classify as Knowledge. Because it’s stuff he has that I don’t.
  Interviewer: so his Knowledge contains Information?
  Participant: Yes.
  Interviewer: He sends back directed guidance as Knowledge which contains Information. But the flow is labeled Knowledge, because it’s an expression of his Knowledge?
  Participant: That makes sense.
  Interviewer: It actually makes complete sense to me. What else?
  Participant: I guess the only other thing he does, as an adjective 93 position 92, is that he can put me in touch with other people. I don’t know if you have any points for networking.
  Interviewer: of course I do. Let’s start with a flow from him to you. He creates networking opportunities by sending you what?
  Participant: Contacts?
  Interviewer: Contacts. These contacts are?
  Participant: people? names?
  Interviewer: These people and names are what?
  Participant: So they’re Information. They’re not really Knowledge. I guess they could be Data. It depends on your definition.
  Interviewer: Of course. Are they Data? Are they a different sort of Data than your other Data?
  Participant: If they are Data, then yes they are.
  Interviewer: Are they Data?
  Participant: I’m an position 58 by background, I can’t tell you anything.
  Interviewer: It’s so much fun pinning position 58s down, because they squirm.
  Participant: Yeah, I can feel myself squirming. I would say: “Look, you can put them in a list. There is a defined quantity. They can be grouped, they can be ordered or whatever. They probably are Data. You can put them in a spreadsheet.
  Interviewer: But they’re different Data. How can we characterize this Data as different Data?
  Participant: They’re people.
  Interviewer: They’re not numbers.
  Participant: People don’t like to be defined as numbers. They get all kind of emotional at me.
  Interviewer: So, contacts are Data. Do we want to differentiate this flow of Data from your other flows of Data? Is it a difference in nature and kind or just nature? Are you comfortable with us labeling this Data in the sense that it will be perceived as the same as this other Data?
  Participant: Meh.
  Interviewer: Excellent. What other entities do we have?
  Participant: With my position 56 hat on?
  Interviewer: Yes.
  Participant: There are other people who I send Information to but don’t get anything from.
  Interviewer: which entity is this?
  Participant: [name] as my research position 41. As in the [local company] research position 41.
  Interviewer: Research position 41. You’ve got a flow to him of?
  Participant: summary of progress.
  Interviewer: The same flow. And the type of flow?
  Participant: Information?
  Interviewer: Are there any flows back to you? Are there any flows back to other people regarding this interaction?
  Participant: Not particularly. It’s just one sided. It’s just as a courtesy, keeping him in the loop sort of thing. So he knows what’s going on but doesn’t necessarily have a direct hand.
  Interviewer: What else do we have?
  Participant: I guess you can put other position 56s at [academic institution], but I don’t do much with them.
  Interviewer: If you don’t do much with them, then they’re not relevant. Two other areas to explore. Communications with yourself wearing other hats and communication with tools.
  Participant: Does my computer count as a tool? That’s really my only tool.
  Interviewer: Do you use different programs on your computer in meaningful ways?
  Participant: Not heaps. I do all my coding in C. Well, yeah, I’ve done a bit of computer programming before but nothing too extensive before this. But so far I’ve learned C, C++, FORTRAN. They’re not too bad, when you don’t know anything better, they’re not too bad. So I’ve done most of my coding in that. I often use one visualization package that I use to look at results or I just put them in excel.
  ...
  Interviewer: Okay, let’s go with visualization software, and we can lump excel and your other vis stuff in here unless you think we should
  Participant: No that’s fine.
  Interviewer: do you send different stuff to your visualization software than excel?
  Participant: Yes and no. I get the same kind of things back from them. I don’t do an awful lot of transformation stuff. I don’t do a lot of formulas in excel. I just put the numbers in and get graphs. The visualization stuff I’m putting numbers in and I’m getting pictures.
  Interviewer: And you’ve got, and what entity would you say your programming is? How do you conceptualize it in your head?
  Participant: It’s code.
  Interviewer: You as position 56, send the entity known as code, what?
  Participant: I send it Data. I created it though, so how does...
  Interviewer: That’s the question. You send it Data. What Data do you send it?
  Participant: Well I send it the lines that it uses to create the program. So I send it... I don’t know how you would describe that. I write the basis of it. I tell it what to do. But I also send it numbers to work with.
  Interviewer: Let’s differentiate those into two flows. The numbers it needs to work with are?
  Participant: Data.
  Interviewer: And we can label them?
  Participant: inputs.
  Interviewer: You also send it what?
  Participant: I guess I’d classify it as Knowledge. No, it’s Information. It’s kind of all of the above.
  Interviewer: we can certainly combine elements.
  Participant: Not really Information.
  Interviewer: so you send it what?
  Participant: I would call it Knowledge. Because I’m imparting my Knowledge into the code and telling it what to do.
  Interviewer: and what will we label this flow?
  Participant: Maybe model theory or something?
  Interviewer: What other flows are there?
  Participant: Well it just sends back results.
  Interviewer: Same results or are these results different from these results?
  Participant: They are different. But not in nature. Just in ... obviously I’m not going to take every result I take from the code and send it on. Because that would be ridiculous.
  Interviewer: So can we say selected results over here?
  Participant: Yeah.
  Interviewer: What else?
  Participant: That’s really about it.
  Interviewer: when you do debugging, does it send anything?
  Participant: Only when I tell it to.
  Interviewer: when you tell it to send you things, does it send you a flow outside of results?
  Participant: not really. I would say...
  Interviewer: just different kinds of results? How do you interact with the visualization software and does your code directly interact?
  Participant: no.
  Interviewer: How do you interact with the visualization?
  Participant: I send it the selected results.
  Interviewer: the same selected results?
  Participant: Different selected results. You can make it the same as the one that comes out of the code because, for all intents and purposes that’s what I use. The visualization package doesn’t always use all of the results that I send it.
  Interviewer: but it’s the same results, there’s no transformation, there’s just filtering.
  Participant: the filtering is usually done inside the package.
  Interviewer: you send it results, what does it do?
  Participant: it gives me pictures or pretty graphs. like circles and balls. I’ve got very unexciting pictures.
  Interviewer: It sends you back pictures and graphs...
  Participant: The pictures come from one software and the graphs come from the other.
  Interviewer: These pictures are?
  Participant: Data?
  Interviewer: Why are they Data?
  Participant: Because they’re based on particular things.
  Interviewer: So it’s just Data as representation of Data.
  Participant: Yeah.
  Interviewer: It also sends you back graphs. These graphs are?
  Participant: the same thing.
  Interviewer: Data. What else do we have?
  Participant: That’s mostly it.
  Interviewer: Do any of these entities exchange stuff... about your work?
  Participant: to a minor extent. I would say that there’s a minor extent link between my position 92s and my adjective 93 position 92.
  Interviewer: OK, what links are there?
  Participant: All I can think about is discussion.
  Interviewer: Who is discussing with whom?
  Participant: Well, it’s a double sided arrow.
  Interviewer: This discussion is?
  Participant: Information.
  ....
  Interviewer: Let’s see what we can do on verb 94. Which entity do we start with for verb 94?
  Participant: if we’re looking at it from my point of view, so I was an position 58.
  Interviewer: And what flows are there, to what?
  Participant: So my position 41 on the project, we’ll call him the lead position 58. He was just responsible for our group.
  Interviewer: flows, you to lead position 58.
  Participant: I’d send him any work that I’ve done. It’s kind of hard to quantify what I did.
  Interviewer: Are there categories of what you did?
  Participant: Yeah, there are. Maybe I could break it down to three main categories. position 58ing noun 95 work, so noun 95 calculations and stuff like that. Maybe noun 95 calcs?
  Interviewer: And these noun 95 calcs are?
  Participant: They’re Data. noun 95 calcs, and adjective 96 stuff, documentation I guess I’d call it. adjective 96 stuff is kind of stuff that’s done, so we do adjective 96 and we go use a Noun 18 or test a valve. Documentation is all of the documentation that we wrote up ...
  Interviewer: Your ... documentation is?
  Participant: I don’t know what you’d classify it as. I guess it’s a type of Data.
  Interviewer: Can we separate it out into sub-categories?
  Participant: Not really.
  Interviewer: So it’s not Information, it’s not Knowledge.
  Participant: It’s a kind of a bit of Knowledge and a bit of Information and a bit of Data all rolled into one document. So what is the document?
  Interviewer: Let’s start by: “What is the document?”
  Participant: It depends on which document.
  Interviewer: What categories of documents are there?
  Participant: The main ones are descriptions of the noun 97, describing what the noun 97es do. I need to explain that I worked mostly on the noun 98 stuff.
  Interviewer: So we’ve got noun 97 description documentation. This noun 97 description documentation is?
  Participant: Well it’s all the above. It’s all of them.
  Interviewer: So Knowledge + Information + Data?
  Participant: Yeah.
  Interviewer: And documentation not including noun 97 description documentation has what other bits in it?
  Participant: adjective 96 reports.
  Interviewer: So we have adjective 96 stuff, but that’s different from adjective 96 reports.
  Participant: Yes.
  Interviewer: These reports are?
  Participant: They’re Information and Data.
  Interviewer: But not Knowledge?
  Participant: Nope.
  Interviewer: Why not?
  Participant: Because the Knowledge contained in the noun 97 descriptions is a kind of background behind what was done and why. Whereas the adjective 96 report is just a description of what was done during adjective 96 and the results that were obtained. So the dumb stuff is the Information. And the results are the Data.
  Interviewer: are there other categories that we can extract out from documentation?
  Participant: That’ll do for now or we’ll be here all day.
  Interviewer: In documentation, the remainder of the documentation is what?
  Participant: Mostly just Information.
  Interviewer: The adjective 96 stuff is what?
  Participant: I would classify it as adjective 96 results and call it Data.
  Interviewer: All right, what else do we have? What other interactions?
  ...
  Interviewer: are there any flows between position 58 and lead position 58?
  Participant: The lead position 58 tells me what to do?
  Interviewer: What can we label this telling you what to do as?
  Participant: Directions sounds a bit too nice but it will do.
  Interviewer: Direction is?
  Participant: Information, I guess.
  Interviewer: Does the lead position 58 send anything else back to you?
  Participant: I guess they send back Knowledge. I’m trying to think of what form that would come under. But say there’s something in the adjective 96 results that’s not quite as you’d expect it, then they can give advice as to what could be causing it, or what to do to test something  else. So you could call it noun 97 Knowledge. The point of the lead position 58 is for them to have more comprehensive understanding of how things work. You can put some other entities in if you want to. “Other Position 22s.” My main flow of communication with them... My background with the project was that I knew how all of the systems worked because I noun 95ed the system. ... I knew how things worked and so I would explain to them how things worked. ... I guess my main flow to them would be noun 97 understanding. Call it Knowledge.
  Interviewer: Do they send anything to you?
  Participant: They would me adjective 96 results.
  Interviewer: The same ones?
  Participant: The same Data.
  Interviewer: How are they different?
  Participant: Well, it could be... they do adjective 96 on?? other systems. So different results. Whereas the stuff that I send would be whatever I was involved in. If you want another arrow there, they send those adjective 96 results to the lead position 58.
  Interviewer: so these results are?
  Participant: They’re Data.
  Interviewer: What else?
  Participant: The main one I had was the noun 63 position 58. I’d teach them about Position 22ing. I’d probably give them the same noun 97 understanding as the others. They would send back. Well, they would send back understanding of how the noun 63 works. So that would be -- I guess that would be Knowledge. It’s very hard to break it down into data.
  Interviewer: where do you get these noun 95 calculations from?
  Participant: I do them. If we want an entity for them, the best thing is that I do noun 99 modeling, and I use the noun 99 package. That’s a nice little name for it.
  Interviewer: What do you send to the package, and what do you get back?
  Participant: I’d send input, Data. And it gives me, results, Data.
  Interviewer: Anything else?
  Participant: Well, I don’t know where all the equipment is.
  Interviewer: Is the equipment important?
  Participant: Probably not. I mean it is important for the job, but probably not.
  Interviewer: Does the equipment provide Data, Information, Knowledge, or other?
  Participant: Of course it does. It provides all of the above. Well, maybe not Information or Knowledge... It’s very weird thinking of it as a Knowledge transferring. Maybe you could call it the noun 63 that’s giving us Information back. The [object] through it doesn’t really tell you anything.
  Interviewer: OK, the noun 63. What do you send to it? What does it send to you?
  Participant: We don’t really send it anything. Well, I don’t send it anything.
  Interviewer: What does it send to you?
  Participant: It sends noun 97 results. Data, because I don’t have anything better.
  Interviewer: now you mentioned Information at some point, with regards to this.
  Participant: Well, it’s the Information that comes from the results.
  Interviewer: where does that Information get...
  Participant: transformed? Through the position 58. Well, an position 58 looks at it and goes “Yes, that number looks right. Or no that number doesn’t look right. It’s broken.”
  Interviewer: And that’s a transformation into what?
  Participant: It’s a transformation into whether things are working.
  ...
  Interviewer: Define for me, Knowledge. Are there types of Knowledge?
  Participant: I would define Knowledge as something that an individual or entity ... something that an entity possesses. That typically has been learned from somewhere else or gained from experience or whatever that enables them a better understanding then they would have otherwise. My understanding of how things would work is that Knowledge is the noun 97 by which Data is turned into Information. So I would say Data is things. It’s numbers, it’s raw Information. It is something that, on its own, doesn’t mean very much. It’s just stuff. Information is an interpretation of that. So it’s kind of something that is understandable to someone without Knowledge, without even concept of what the raw Data is.
  Interviewer: So it’s encapsulated something? What is it that’s encapsulated?
  Participant: I mean, it can be an explanation of results. It can have nothing to do with it whatsoever.
  Interviewer: So we’ve got Data is transformed by Knowledge into Information. What does Information do and where does it go? It doesn’t just sit there.
  Participant: Information is used as a means of communication.
  Interviewer: What is it communicating and does it cause any changes in anything?
  Participant: I don’t know.
  Interviewer: Where does emotion fall into this if anywhere?
  Participant: Well I’d say it’s fairly separate. However, it can influence how things are perceived. So it probably has an influence on the Information.
  Interviewer: So emotion changes the transformation of Data into Information?
  Participant: I’d say it just changes the perception of Information.
  Interviewer: So Data goes into Knowledge, what’s this flow?
  Participant: Data doesn’t really go into Knowledge.
  Interviewer: Sorry...
  Participant: Data doesn’t turn into Knowledge. Data turns into Information.
  Interviewer: So Data turns into Information. Knowledge...
  Participant: creates that link. So if you don’t have Knowledge, the Data won’t transform very well.
  Interviewer: does Knowledge go into Information?
  Participant: Yes, Information can be a communication of Knowledge.
  Interviewer: Does anything go into Knowledge? How do you get more?
  Participant: Through Information.
  Interviewer: What is Knowledge?
  Participant: understanding inherent to an entity, is how I’d describe it.
  Interviewer: Three questions: Is there anything to either side of Data, Information, or Knowledge? Is there anything that’s lower than Data? Or is Data atomic?
  Participant: I would say Data can be atomic. It stretches across that width of the spectrum. I would say that it goes from as far as atomic to as big as macroscopic. It can be anything within that. I’m saying that in any sense.
  Interviewer: Data can be divided or it cannot. If Data is divided, what is it divided into?
  Participant: Subdata?
  Interviewer: Is subdata a thing? Or is subdata Data?
  Participant: I would say it’s not any different. You could have different scales of it, but... you could have a group of numbers. You could select some of that group of numbers. That’s not any different. It’s just still Data.
  Interviewer: So you have a subset of Data which is Data.
  Participant: Yeah.
  Interviewer: and at some point you just can’t subset any more.
  Participant: You could get it right down to the last point... It’s still Data
  Interviewer: You could have many points, and that collection of points is still Data.
  Participant: Yeah.
  Interviewer: But you have a collection of points, and you apply Knowledge and you get ... Information? And then you’ve got this loop of Information to Knowledge and Knowledge to Information. Is there anything beyond Knowledge?
  Participant: I would say no. I would say the only thing beyond Knowledge is god. I mean God is all Knowledge. That just gets confusing. &lt;inaudible&gt;
  Interviewer: Because it is part of some people’s ontologies, but it’s outside the scope of this investigation ... When someone gives you a normative assertion, it’s what of these, if anything? When someone orders you to do something, is that Data, Information, or Knowledge?
  Participant: None of them.
  Interviewer: What is it? Do we have a handy label for it?
  Participant: I don’t know. If anything, I’d say it falls under Information, but I don’t think it does.
  Interviewer: So what is Information?
  Participant: It’s a lot of stuff.
  Interviewer: What’s a component of Information?
  Participant: It could be an interpretation of something. It could just be words. Understanding, words. I would say if someone asks someone to do something, provides them a direction or a directive, it’s not necessarily a should, but, provides them guidance to what they should do, I would say that’s Information, they’re giving them Information on what to do.
  Interviewer: The guidance is what to do based on what?
  Participant: Based on that entity’s understanding. Based on their Knowledge or their Information. Or the interpretation they’ve got of things.
  Interviewer: Any final thoughts?
  Participant: Nope.
  ....
  Interviewer: ... your use of Emotion as a perception of manipulation engine is fascinating. So, thank you for that.
  Participant: That’s OK. Maybe that’s where should comes into it. Maybe it that when someone tells you that you should do something, they’re kind of applying their emotiveness behind it. In that, ??? said, it’s a manipulative thing. It’s not necessarily a “I’m guiding you to do this.” It’s a I’m making or telling you that you must do this. So they’re exercising their manipulativeness over them. Which can be a good thing. Like a position 41 with an employee might help them to do something. And that’s manipulation.
  Interviewer: and so it’s an emotive communication of...
  Participant: status in the hierarchy. Maybe that’s emotive, maybe that’s not really emotive.

A brief discussion on entities. An entitiy is something, someone, that takes in these flows, performs some sort of transformation on them, and outputs flows. Or produces flows, or takes in flows. I would say that, when I was doing tmy masters, I had three roles: I was a student, I was a teaching assistant, and I was the database position 31. For purposes of this diagram, I would be three different entities because not only do they deal with Data, Information, Knowledge, in different ways, but they can talk to each other. Even though it’s me talking to me, it’s me as DBA going: I just wrote this lab me, here are the questions we need to deal with. It’s the DBA talking to the graduate assistant, there are different ways of dealign with stuff. We will ignore things that are ready-at-hand. This pen is not an entitiy because I don’t think about it when I’m writing, I just write. Say I use that computer and I load up SAS, and I load up the 100,000 words of transcript that I’ve written so far. And it munges them and it produces something. SAS is an entitiy becuase it’s taking stuff in and giving me something. It’s noun 97ing it, and I’m aware that it’s noun 97ing it. It’s an eneity to me because it’s not just an invisible flow it’s go there, come back. Scientific instruments can be entities, they can take stuff... What I’m trying to do is be very vague here so I don’t prejudice your philosophy. This is why I’m saying if you think doing an entitiy dictionary is useful we’ll do it. If you’ve got a fairly decent idea, we’ll start trivial and expand out.
  Participant: we’ll start trivial?
  Interviewer: Let’s start by talking about one of the really beautiful noun 37 cases we just talked about with that semipermiable membrane. With ..
  Participant: technology / business .
 Interviewer: we start out by going what is one of the central entities in this noun 97? probably a role that you play, but it doesn’t have to be.
  Participant: As the collector, just call it the noun 129 entity. noun 129.
  Interviewer: multiple people can be in one entity.
  Participant: noun 129. What happens in the noun 129 well: the inputs are observations....
  Interviewer: What is effectively sending you observations?
  Participant: position 90s. We’ll probably do this around [name]. So the position 90s. These are corridor conversations. You’ll be sitting there and some position 90 will say: “Do you know such and such?” ... and the position 90s will come around for a little chat. Because they know I’m there. And you pick up all sorts of things that are going on. That’s the informal observations.
  Interviewer: So we have position 90s sending a flow to noun 129. This flow is observations?
  Participant: Just observations. They push the buttons in the noun 97. They hear things, they see things. They know how the noun 97. They know the differences between the shifts. And if you want to put a credibility factor on it, around 20
  Interviewer: position 90s send you a flow of observations. Here’s the fun bit. Would you categorize this flow as Data, Information, Knowledge, or something different?
  Participant: Can I pick two?
  Interviewer: absolutely.
  Participant: Information and Knowledge. Because the Information is the things that I can reduce to something technical. The Knowledge is their understanding of the noun 97. ... what’s their perception of the basis of [their choices]. Information to me would be the technical side of it. The Knowledge is the operational expertise. So you’re getting some of those two things coming through.
  Interviewer: So they send you observations. The observations are Knowledge, or are Information.
  Participant: Pretty nebulous. Handwavy stuff. Some as good as gold.
  Interviewer: Is there a flow from noun 129 back to the position 90s?
  Participant: Yes. There probably are many. But again, it’s limited to the ones that you talk to. And it’s, for me, trying to “this is the next level down of telling the story” of why, why do these things happen? hang on fellas, that’s not the way it works, this is it. Some of them? [company] ... ??? Interesting story, giving a presentation. This was a few years ago. It was noun 131s. These things are like big bowls. So we’re doing a formal presentation, there’s about half a dozen, a position 106 from here... I start giving this background of noun 131s. And this guy says: “[name], what you’re really saying, independant of type of noun 61, they all form  for the same reason” and I say “spot on.” Did group 130 get that? no. But one of the position 90s picked it up in 5 minutes of me talking. And so, that was a formal feedback to the position 90s, but when I go back, there’s a lot of informal value in the corridor. noun 131s is all about this. Noun 21 noun 132 is all about this. noun 137 is about this. So, for me personally, there is an informal feedback.
  Interviewer: So there’s feedback back, whether it’s formal or informal, it takes about the same form?
  Participant: Yes. Just talking. Just start drawing lines on a whiteboard. Putting together the pieces of the jigsaw puzzle into some sort of digestable ... my job is to tell a story. The complexity of that story depends on the audience.
  Interviewer: Would you say the feedback is Data, Information, Knowledge, or other?
  Participant: It’s my Knowledge, but I’m giving it back as Information.
  Interviewer: Let’s unpack that. Would you say the flow is absolutely generated from your Knowledge, and you assert that they percieve the flow as Information?
  Participant: Yes.
  Interviewer: Would you say the flow itself is a flow of Knowledge, or a flow of Information?
  Participant: Put the two together I’d say.
  Interviewer: Why?
  Participant: Because the Knowledge base that I’m drawing on, is much more substantial than these.
  Interviewer: So you’re passing them Knowledge, but that they accept as Information?
  Participant: Yes.
  Interviewer: What do they do with that Information?
  Participant: They probably stew about it. Would they incoproate that into their actions? No.
  Interviewer: Which is why you would categorize it as Information?
  Participant: Yes. BEcause I have no power to direct which way they want to noun 97. That would hopefully be operating through the form of noun 88. My role in that loop is to just give them the background why? They might agetate for that, “But [name] says this.” But [name] doesn’t have a clue. Every now and then, if it’s the right sort of segment, they will push that in.
  Interviewer: So you would say that it’s not so much a flow of Information and Knowledge, as that it comes from you as a Knowledge flow, and then becomes an Information flow they accept. ... Are there other flows between these two entities?
  Participant: in the example I’m thinking about, no. Because I’m here as the blowing consultant. You’re hoping that the formal loop of noun 88 would be reinforcing that message. That would be from this entitiy up to the noun 88 entitiy.
  Interviewer: What do we want to label that as?
  Participant: noun 88? This is the group that sets the operational procedures and standards. This is how you shoot this wheel into that position. You will run this noun 97 at this speed. You will do this if the noun 132 in the Noun 21 exceeds this value. That’s the formal bit. So, what I provide to them is the written report which is Knowledge, I would suspect.
  Interviewer: So there’s a flow from you to them, of Knowledge.
  Participant: Formal Knowledge. This is documented.
  Interviewer: So you would categorize it as a different kind of Knowledge?
  Participant: Yes. This is the next level up in technical understanding.
  Interviewer: This formal Knowledge flow... what’s the content of the flow? Just as the content of this is observations.
  Participant: This will be Dsets, analysis, and some observational material that supports it. This is really about the formal Data set.
  Interviewer: So you’re passing to noun 88, the distilled version...
  Participant: you probably do release your Data sets. There will be tables and numbers. If it’s an analysis, there will be a table of numbers.
  Interviewer: But this is your interpreted noun 97, refined...
  Participant: This is my certified... Data set. I believe the Data set that best and most reliably represents the analyses that we’ve taken as part of this. Simple things like the tables add up to a sensitive number. If you look at noun 133 analyses, the table is not necessarily 100
  Interviewer: But they’re certified, because...
  Participant: They fit more or less intenral guidelines that you have for quality of Data. If it’s outside, there’s something wrong with it. I’ve gotten analyses out of there that only total 70
  Interviewer: Where do you get the Data for this certified Data set?
  Participant: From noun 37 and analyses.
  Interviewer: In the chain of entities that may provide you with this Data set, what is the penultimate one?
  Participant: For me personally, it is a physical noun 37 for which I have an analysis.
  Interviewer: So we have noun 37?
  Participant: noun 37. That’s only because of how I take problems, and the sort of problems I take. The position 134 says I want the noun 37.  The position 135 says I want the analysis. For the people here, it will be a block of noun 97 Data. [Name]: “I’ve got two years noun 97 Data.” I’ve got a relationship.” His noun 37 is actually the set of noun 97 Data. And for me, occasionally, that’s probably my second set. I’ll look down to the noun 97 Data.
  Interviewer: So we’ve an entity “noun 97 Data”
  Participant: Yes.
  Interviewer: Do we want to say that the entity is noun 97 Data, or say that it’s a noun 97 DB?
  Participant: I’m extracting specific variables from a DB. [name], could you get me tail Noun 23 and noun 28 chemistry? Can you get me Noun 21 noun 132s from noun 136 such and such? Can you get me the Noun 21 noun 137? can you get me the delivery noun 137 stock? That’s a DB. Someone else will extract that for me.
  Interviewer: Let’s start with noun 37. Do you send any flows to the noun 37?
  Participant: I hope not. No.
  Interviewer: What flows do you get from the noun 37?
  Participant: I get noun 37, observation. I see the physical nature of the noun 37.
  Interviewer: Let’s go with physical nature?
  Participant: Yes. This looks like normal Noun 21 for [company.] This stuff’s undergoing [term]. It’s different. It shouldn’t have done this in three days. There’s somethign about the physical nature.
  Interviewer: So you’re taking physical nature. The flow of observations of physical nature is Data,Information, Knowledge, other?
  Participant: Information. But I’m using my Knowledge to assign the Information, parameters, based on my previous experience.
  Interviewer: Unpack that for me. You would say that it’s Information...
  Participant: It’s Information. But that Information is actually based on an experience and technology???.
  Interviewer: Here’s a better question. You say that this Information is a function of your prior Knowledge. Where is the input of your prior Knowledge such that this Information is produced.
  Participant: It’s my long term experience with ... Or anything for that matter. If we went to: “What do I do with these noun 37?” First is observation. The second is some sort of chemical analysis. And the third thing, which i’ll come back to is what it looks like at the end of a microscope. And one of the more or less concepts that I push to people is that the story should be independant of scale. In the sense that what I see down the microscope and what I see in the specimen. Or what I see from the scanning electron microscope, they should be a consistent story. When I write the summary those observations should  be independant of scale. They should be what I see. A lot of it is what I see down the microscope has to match in some way, shape, or form, what the SEM is telling me. They tell you different bits of the story, but they must be consistent. They must be the same story. Or compatible with the same story. And, I keep talking about what you see in textures and materials should in some way or form, be explainable between the two. The SEM and the optical microscope. Some people don’t see it that way. “Oh! but this is different.” No, there the same mateirals. How you see them may be slightly different, but the story should be consistent. The next level down. It may not look the same, you’re just seeing different visualizations of the same thing. That’s probably something about the noun 37.
  Interviewer: Okay, what it looks like is that physical nature and information isn’t a direct flow. That story tells me that there’s a role that acts as an intermediary between noun 37 and noun 129. What is that role?
  Participant: That role, that’s the Knowledge role? Knowledge or expertise?
  Interviewer: It’s the person making the observations. What name can we put to that role?
  Participant: I’m loathe to say. But it’s almost like an expert, it’s an expertise I have.
  Interviewer: what I see is that noun 129 sends to this role Knowledge.
  Participant: yes.
  Interviewer: This role gets something from the noun 37, combines it with Knowledge, and sends physical nature as Information back into the noun 129.
  Participant: into the develoopment to write the story.
  Interviewer: So we’ve got role X here ... you as noun 129 sends Knowledge to this role. This Knowledge is expertise?
  Participant: Yes. Accumulated expertise which goes right back to noun 134 training in a lot of ways. Everything has a precident in the past. An organization that forgets its past doesn’t have a future. It’s the same thing.
  Interviewer: And you get the physical nature from this entity. You as noun 129. I’m pretty sure they’re both you. Now, this entity, we can call it expert. Can we call it something else? What would you call it if you were telling someone else to take noun 37 for you.
  Participant: If I had pre-knowledge of what we were verb 73, I’d say look out for.... I was just thinking that yes I had been in a situation. Usually the critical thing is: just get me a noun 37. “Oh, oh, we’ve got the noun 37.” But that, in the industrial sense is extremely hard. Usually if you’ve got a bit more control, you want to refine your location. The noun 138 that you’d like to take a noun 37 from. ...
  Interviewer: Not just I want a noun 37, but I want a noun 37 from that thing.
  Participant: The noun 139 there. I want a noun 37 out of thatnoun 140 and I want it pretty soon... And I will go to the pile and pick it out. “Well, that’s different, that’s different.” Because you’re almost doing the analytical stage in your head. “Oh, we’ve got a noun 37.” and the next question is: well wehere was it? I don’t remember. That’s part of it’s: what is its relationship to its other entities? What was its orientation? Is this the top or the bottom? Simple things like that. Usually in giving guidelines for verb 73, it’s “get me a noun 37.”
  Interviewer: position 141.
  Participant: Yes, position 141. And usually you keep it s simple as possible. The best option for me is get me a whole noun 37 and I’ll go over it, and I’ll pick out the noun 37 I really need. And that’s the way I usually work when I can. But if its ??? just get us a noun 37. And with pictures. That’s probably the best thing. Digitial cameras are absolutely terrific. Take a few pictures of where it’s coming from. And then go ‘I’ve got use for the things.”
  Interviewer: So that means that noun 37 is sending to the position 141 something. The position 141 is also sending to noun 129 pictures.
  Participant: Observations. Recorded observations that you can make something out of. Recorded site observations. Here’s the picture. It’s usually got a time on the bottom of it. We usually know where it’s come from. And out of the picture you can probably scale things. “Well, that’s usually there too...” It’s .25 mil, it’s about half a mil across. So this digital image that’s an observation, but it’s recorded. Once you’ve got it recorded, you’re in business.
  Interviewer: This flow of recorded site observations is: Data, Information, Knowledge, other?
  Participant: I’d say it would have to be Data. This is stuff you can do things... this is something you can reduce to a number. It also has observations, but it’s reducable to a number.
  Interviewer: The noun 37 flow to position 141 is what? The position 141 is the one that uses your expertise to produce the physical nature. So it’s taker, but it’s also the person who procsses the noun 37. So the noun 37 to the sampe taker is what?
  Participant: It’s embodied Information, isn’t it? Shoved another qualifier on the front of it. He doesn’t inherently know what it is. But the noun 37 embodies Information. Information, it might, and if you do an analysis on it, it’s Data.
  Interviewer: So where’s the Data here?
  Participant: Probably just noun 37 needs to be split into its an observation, it’s a physical noun 37, and it’s also what you do with that noun 37.
  Interviewer: Let’s look at flows here. We’ve got physical
  Participant: A physical body that you can hold in your hand.
  Interviewer: We would say that the physical body is an embodiment of Information?
  Participant: Yes. And ultimately it can be reduced to hard numbers. The Data.
  Interviewer: That reduction of hard numbers is performed by the position 141 and given to noun 129?
  Participant: Yes.
  Interviewer: So we’ve got another flow here. These hard numbers, what’s the label of it?
  Participant: A chemical analysis. This chemical analysis is... this is all hard numbers. Here is an analysis. This is real. This is hard Data. This comes down to numbers which hopefully will ??? properly. By standards, it’s real Data.
  Interviewer: We also have other things going from the noun 37 to the position 141, besides the physical body. Right?
  Participant: Yes.
  Interviewer: What are those?
  Participant: Information. Simple as “this is the date I collected it, it was raining.”
  Interviewer: environmental?
  Participant: environmental. It was picked off this noun 136. This noun 136, it had changed colour. It’s thats sort of observations.
  Interviewer: These environmental observations are?
  Participant: They’re not Data. Information?
  Interviewer: As a note, don’t use exclusion. find some word that it fits even if we have to make up new words.
  Participant: I think it’s Information. it’s creating a picture of the problem.
  Interviewer: Do we want to say provenance instead of envionmental observations?
  Participant: Provenance is a slightly different sort of thing.
  Interviewer: Is there a flow of provenance or is provenance a function of?
  Participant: If you’re looking where other people have taken noun 37, provenance becomes extremely important. If you know, the position 141, but there’s another position 141 out here, it’s like an expansion of this -- noun 129 request and we do have examples of this. ... position 141, then there’s a nother loop out here,... research doing things, and they’re doing various things. And the provenance of any of their noun  37 becomes critical. Where it’s like this is the noun 37 and I’m the position 141, provenance is not an issue because it’s embodied in the observation. But if it was on the other side there, you’d like to know something of the proenance of the noun 37.
  Interviewer: Therefore, where’s the provenance flow? And what is it?
  Participant: Provenance flow, it’s probably a subset of this interaction here, but it is another point removed.
  Interviewer: Point removed from what?
  Participant: The immediatcy of the noun 37? There’s a flow there, and it’s really Information.
  Interviewer: Are there any other flows of Data, Information, Knowledge, or other coming from the noun 37 to anyone?
  Participant: No, I don’t think so. It’s all being more or less channeled through this loop here. It’s channeling through one entity. Sometimes this will be ircumvented because they’ll do it themselves, but really, in the way I’m thinking about things, it’s this. This is the noun 129 role. I take in all this Information, distill it down to a story, and pass it on.
  Interviewer: Is there a flow of story here?
  Participant: Usually a story back this way so they know what they’re doing.
  Interviewer: So noun 129 sends to position 141 story?
  Participant: Story. Why do I want to do this? What is the background thing? What is the rationality for doing this? This is not a stupid exercise.
  Interviewer: So noun 129 sends to position 141, rationale.
  Participant: Rationale. Why are we doing this?
  Interviewer: This rationale is?
  Participant: It’s Knowledge. Because I know the people involved, I know that they like to have some idea of why are we doing this? Oh, [name] says this about it. Otherwise it’s shit. But if they understand why, they’re likely to do it. If they don’t understand ???
  Interviewer: Even if the role of position 141 is in your own head, you still have to justify to yourself the rationale.
  Participant: Why would I be spending money on this thing if it won’t go? There’s a rationale for myself and there’s a rationalie for other people.
  Interviewer: Does the rationale go to anyone else, or is it a different rationale that goes to other people?
  Participant: The rationale heading in that direction is probably much the same.
  Interviewer: Is it the same rationale?
  Participant: If you distill it down to its simplest form, yes.
  Interviewer: So it’s a simplified rationale.
  Participant: It’s simplified going this way, this is more detailed.
  Interviewer: So noun 129 to position 141 is simplified.
  Participant: I need this noun 37 because it will tell me something about this event. I need the Data to see what’s going on.
  Interviewer: Whereas noun 129 to noun 88...
  Participant: It’s detailed. “These things don’t ever add up, I think we need a noun 37, and we need this about the noun 37” Same basic motivation, it’s got a lot more detail.
  Interviewer: Are they both Knowledge?
  Participant: Is gut feeling Knowledge?
  Interviewer: It’s entirely up to you whether or not you want to categorize it as that.
  Participant: I think it’s Knowledge, because it’s something your own makeup that says this is valuable. It’s a form of Knowledge. It’s Knowledge. Knowledge is the sum of experience, activity, that sort of things. “Why are we doing this? Well, in the past, this has worked. I’ve read about this activity in the paper. I’ve put 2 and 2 together and this is my rationale for doing this sort of thing. The Knowledge is the sum of what has been successful in the past, what has been a flop, why was it a flop, where did I go wrong? The formal learning.
  Interviewer: Is learning different from experience?
  Participant: That’s a question for an education person. I think it is. ... The activities you’ve engaged in, previous experience, experimental sort of things. Learning, And what you’ve seen other people do.
  Interviewer: What would that be?
  Participant: It would be an observation. You’ve seen them doing this, and “jeeze, it worked. I’ll try that.” This is probably not out of the textbook, either.
  ...
  Interviewer: We have the noun 97 DB over here. It looks awful lonely. Who plays with the noun 97 database?
  Participant: noun 88...
  Interviewer: noun 88 to noun 97 database... does what?
  Participant: They, in my vision of things, they check the integrity of the Data that is actually going into the DB. In the sense that we’ve had a little bit of yesterday’s noun 97 Information. That point’s not right. Something’s gone wrong there. There’s some sort of quality review of the material that has actually long-term resident in the DB.
  Interviewer: In that case, we have a flow... let’s start with the first flow of: stuff goes into the noun 97 database. From where?
  Participant: [list of redacted terms] ... the whole infrastructure. Computers, ... servers. And probably another aside to think about over my working life, there’s been a very distinct change in the perception of those sorts of measurements. In the sense of -- when I did my noun 91, measurements were were extremely expensive to do. A noun 74 cell was an extremely expensive piece of gear. They certainly weren’t refined in the Noun 4 precision or accuracy that we have today. And the were extremely expensive. And you noun 95ed your experiments effectively to extract the maximum amount of Information. Maximum reliable Information from experimentation. That’s probably what I’d go on with. That’s part of the Knowledge DB. This is the experience, this ???. Nowdays, because a Noun 4, a DP setting you can get it for a thousand bucks. To wire it into the computer is another thousand. So two grand for a point. Ah, we’ll go for more Data. You see noun 60s instead of 20 years ago, you might have a thousand points in a noun 60, now you might have twenty thousand. Y’know, we’ve got all this Data, but you think “are we doing anything with it?” One of my [old] jobs [somewhere else] was condition monitoring and melting. “When are we actually getting to the refracteries? When are they going to fire?” So they put in a condition monitoring system. My argument was always: “You need to watch this data ??? times ago, it’s your best Data.” “Oh, no, no, we’ve got in a conditioning monitoring system. “ That was the group 130. “And we can measure the Data.” But no one looks at it. To me we have this philosophy, oh we’ll just measure everything and hope that the analysis just trickles out some sort of sense. Whereas I come from an era where you noun 95 the experiment and you have a good idea of how you’re going to extract it. You don’t really much else. It’s planning. You see that, we keep adding more and more noun 97 Noun 4. And you ask the question of [other company], “what are you going to do with this?” “Something.” noun 88:”We might have a look at this thing.” but in the context of the whole operating campaign or at least the last year, you don’t know the reliability of the Information, you don’t see the built in trends, and you’re probably shooting in the dark. But you’ve got the Data points. Three quarters of the Data in the DB, you don’t know how it was [collected]. Just a change in the way businesses perceive things now. But we’ve got this and we’ve got that. But you’ve got to be actively worrying the Data. Pulling out the stories, making sense of it. And it’s a little bit upsetting, but that’s the nature of the game. You’d probably hear much of the same story from [name]. Who: “Oh, we’ll go back and have a look at the D” Uhhh. You’ve got to start sorting it. They’re trying to make the stories out of the Data. Wheras, me, coming here, would probably noun 95 the concept for the system and how we’re going to extract the Data, what we want to do with it, and you start from times of your own. The focus is on getting the position 58ing, and once the position 58ing’s there, we’ll be right. No, no, it doesn’t quite work that way.
  ...
  Interviewer: The noun 60, Noun 4, and infrastructure send to the noun 97 DB...
  Participant: Data. This is hard numbers.
  Interviewer: This Data, these hard numbers, do we have a label?
  Participant: noun 97 variables. This is a measurement of Noun 12, or noun 74, or flow, or concentrate.
  Interviewer: Some variable of the noun 97. These noun 97 variables, they go into the noun 97 DB. Does anything else, in a general sense, go into the noun 97 database?
  Participant: There are probably operational items which do go in. Probably from switches, more than anything else. Start a cast. A binary noun 111, it’s on or off. Bang, that was the commencement of casting.
  Interviewer: Switches send to the noun 97 DB what?
  Participant: Status Information. Casting, not casting. Power on, power off.
  Interviewer: Is this flow of status Information, Data, Information, or Knowledge?
  Participant: probably Data and Information. Some of it are numbers like ladle weight for instance. That’s a hard number. Start a cast, end a cast, that sort of thing is Information. It’s on or it’s off. It’s going to be a combination of hard numerical stuff, quantities, masses. And the Information is we are in this state, we are not in this state. It’s just, tick when we’re not casting, not running noun 28. And probably how many bowls of noun 28. That will probably be matched up with hard Data. In the sense that there will probably be a chemical analysis.
  Interviewer: noun 97 variables or something different?
  Participant: Something different.
  Interviewer: Where is the chemical analysis here?
  Participant: It’s probably another one of these noun 37.
  Interviewer: From noun 37 to noun 97 DB?
  Participant: Yes. Via the laboratory.
  Interviewer: So we’ve got noun 37 to lab. And we’ve got lab to noun 97 database?
  Participant: Yes. And that doesn’t come through this loop, it’s a completely different loop. It’s another group of position 90s out there.
  Interviewer: And they just input their things into the DB.
  Participant: Yeah, they’ll have “we’ve sent the noun 37 to the lab, this is its number, bang blam bang.” All that is not observational, the noun 37 is a physical entity, the Data that comes from that noun 37 is Data. There’s no observation.
  Interviewer: noun 37 to lab, this flow?
  Participant: is a physical noun 37.
  Interviewer: Would you say the physical noun 37 embodies anything?
  Participant: It embodies Knowledge. It embodies the actual checmial compisition.
  Interviewer: And that, you would say, is Knowledge?
  Participant: That’s Knowledge.
  Interviewer: So there’s a flow of Knowledge from the noun 37 to the lab
  Participant: Yeah, in the third prty. The noun 37 inherently contains Knowledge. Or is it Data?
  Interviewer: You tell me.
  Participant: Data. It’s Data. That will come down as a hard analysis and stuff.
  Interviewer: The noun 37 to the lab sends Data. The label for this Data is?
  Participant: Physical noun 37. And it embodies Data, hard numbers.
  Interviewer: Versus the physical body to the position 141 which embodies Information.
  Participant: Information, yeah.
  Interviewer: The lab takes this physical noun 37, the data flow of physical noun 37,
  Participant: Is extracted by the lab, and the lab sends to the noun 97 DB, the embodied Data.
  Interviewer: Is it a data flow?
  Participant: I’d say it’s Data flow. They’re not doing anything with it. It spits out of the noun 133 or the the spark. Bang, how much of these. No one makes an interpretation, it’ just a string of numbers.
  Interviewer: The lab sends Data to the noun 97 DB of what label?
  Participant: noun 37 chemistry.
  Interviewer: The noun 97 DB takes these three things in, are there any other major components that it takes in.
  Participant: Apart from the time, no.
  Interviewer: Time. Does it take in time from something different?
  Participant: It is probably a timing against its own timestamp. When something arrives, noun 97 Information, it arrived at this time. A clock entity. 24 hour clock starting at midnight, standard noun 97. Anything happens, it starts at midnight. Why? that’s 00:00.
  Interviewer: The clock sends to the noun 97 DB a timestamp.
  Participant: Data.
  Interviewer: noun 97 DB. Now there’s interaction between noun 88 and noun 97 DB. The noun 97 DB sends to control, what?
  Participant: DB sends to noun 88 Data. It is interrogted and it downloads number streams.
  Interviewer: So it sends a flow of Data to noun 88 of what?
  Participant: Numerical Information. noun 97 variable values.
  Interviewer: What do we want to label that flow?
  Participant: I would say Data.
  Interviewer: So it’s a Data flow of Data?
  Participant: You’re getting me confused. It’s a data flow of hard numerical Information against predefined variables. So this is a ??? it’s its value.
  Interviewer: Do we have a more pithy name than hard defined Information against predefined values?
  Participant: Just call them noun 97 variables.
  Interviewer: We have noun 97 variables here. Are these noun 97 variables different from the noun 97 variables that noun 88 gets?
  Participant: No, they will be the same throughout.
  Interviewer: What about all this extra stuff?
  Participant: I would call that a noun 97 variable, in the sense that if you’re doing a chemical analysis, hot metal silicon, it’s like a noun 97 variable. So they may not be instrumental values, but they would have a defined tag to define them. And it’s a number against the tag. In the same sense as the tag.
  Interviewer: Can we put an adjective before either of these things? Like stored or current?
  Participant: The DB goes back goodness knows how many years. So it’s effectively stored and stored for some time.
  Interviewer: Do we want to say historical?
  Participant: Historical.
  Interviewer: Historical noun 97 variables go to noun 88.
  Participant: From, from. Current time back. Then we can pull them out, and that goes back to noun 88. And it can also be interrogated by noun 129.
  Interviewer: Therefore noun 88 and noun 129 neeed to be able to send stuff to the noun 97 DB in order to interrogate.
  Participant: Yes, that’s the program commands. I want to see this string for this time period of these variables. It commands...
  Interviewer: These program commands are?
  Participant: Information requests.
  Interviewer: Information requests is the category?
  Participant: Yes. You send it a command and the command is to fill an Information requirement.
  Interviewer: So noun 129 and program control send an Information request to the noun 97 DB. The noun 97 DB then sends historical noun 97 variables to both, back.
  Participant: whomever’s requesting it. ... Just on here, you sketch plan there, you’ve probably got from between ten and a hundred people interactions. people, man-machine interactions. You’re looking at ten people. noun 97ing, effectively on one shift, 30 people. the side loops, we’re talking generalities, not time based.
  Interviewer: What else do we have here?
  Participant: I think we need a bigger sheet of paper. There’s not much more I think you can talk about as a separate entitiy. This loop here, there’s probably four strings to it. You can talk about noun 97 noun 37, you can talk about raw material noun 37, but I think they all fall into the same sort of concept. And there’s multiple streams for these sorts of things. Probably the next step is how that comes forward and that comes forward to the business given that they’re part of the business , these are one step behind the business . The barriers is, you can probably put it through there. For them, that’s the barrier. For noun 129 the barrier has come back, because you’ve got this communication loop around here.
  Interviewer: noun 88 to noun 129.
  Participant: This is where it starts to get hazy. And it gets hazy. There’s probably line group 130, which is the operational superentendant. His Position 22s
  Interviewer: Everyone who’s doing work on the line
  Participant: On the line, yep. Who supervise the noun 97, who probably have a comission to see the noun 129 of the noun 97. This is the maintnence and money. This is getting up to the dollar signs of the business . The next one up here is group 142. This is ... line maangemangement would be [name]’s superentdenant. Raw material position 92. The group 142 would be like noun 60 general mangagers. Very very much removed. You’ve got to summarize it for them. When you go here, it’s a one page summary, and up to here is a one paragraph.
  Interviewer: Because they’ve got so much...
  Participant: They’ve got so much, and they’re distilling down...
  Interviewer: Any other big big entities here?
  Participant: I don’t think we’ll go as far as the shareholders.
  Interviewer: They go money...
  Participant: Yes, but I think there are some shareholders that care about the businesses they invest in. I’ve invested in this business for  ethical reasons. So I’m interested in what they’re doing. Yes, money is proabbly the root cause of it. People do carry interests about the business, probably some of the interest is “can I get my investment out of this?” and some of them, yes, I’ll invest in this business because of etchial reasons. Some of the noun 129 work does filter through. This is from experience, some of this work does filter through into annual reports. It was greatly filtered through, I might add, but it does filter through, and it can happen.
  Interviewer: Here’s a question. Are the secretaries of any of these bodies a different entity? Or equivalent gatekeepers?
  Participant: Yes. They are usually the acess point to a lot of these people. Especially when you get up here. And I’ve found that... my access to [person]... the access to him is through his secretary. Because if you go straight to him, whoosh, into the aether. Gone. No response to any e-mail. But you ring up [name], I need to do this, “right [name], Ok, when do you want to see [name] sometime on this day, this day, or this day?” So there are gatekeepers for the very senior levels of group 130.
  Interviewer: Are there line secretaries?
  Participant: Not in the [company] organization, not in its current form. They can make your life easy or they can make it damned difficult.
  Interviewer: Flows.
  Participant: There’s a big one here. This is the day to day reporting, direction...
  Interviewer: So noun 88 sends reporting to line group 130.
  Participant: Yes, they report on a day by day, problem by problem basis.
  Interviewer: What shall we label that as? Are there two flows?
  Participant: It’s a day by day. Day reports. “And we had this problem overnight, and this abnormal report, and I don’t know what the reason is. And the noun 97 is ticking over. [elements] are down. We’re having problems with the Noun 21.” It’s all that sort of Information, Data. Some of it’s numerical, some of it’s observations.
  Interviewer: So it’s Information &amp; Data?
  Participant: Information &amp; Data. With some interpretation.
  Interviewer: And the interpretation is the Information?
  Participant: Probably the interpretation is Knowledge.
  Interviewer: Is that a separate flow?
  Participant: They’re all in the one. Because these are usually [short term hires]. “I’m in this job for a couple of years and I don’t really understand what I’m doing.” These blokes, these are the long term campaigners. They carry all of the sort of history, the Knowledge, what’s been done in the past, sometimes we get it wrong. Most of the time it’s going to be pretty right.
  Interviewer: noun 88 sends the day to day reports to line group 130. These reports are Information, Data, and Knowledge.
  Participant: Yes. And a whole host of abnormal event reports.
  Interviewer: Separate flow?
  Participant: They’re all embodied in the day to day Information that’s going across. What do we need to do? What are we going to get roasted on? It’s all this mass of stuff.
  Interviewer: It’s this embolism of reports. Line group 130 to noun 88?
  Participant: Are usually directives. What we would like to happen. Where do we need to push the noun 97? Why aren’t we... what’s the situation in the Noun 21 salvage questions. And it’s directives. And in very rare cases there may be Information coming back.
  Interviewer: Directives are a flow of?
  Participant: Requests, Information?
  Interviewer: Information?
  Participant: Information. Someone says “I want this to happen in the ... noun 60.”
  Interviewer: And you say that that statement is Information?
  Participant: In your classification scheme, sure. Mine would be a request. “We want you to do this. I want you to have a look at this problem.”
  Interviewer: and this is a request that is neither Data, Information, nor Knowledge.
  Participant: No, they’re requests for Information.
  Interviewer: in all of this, are there any that we need to change to match your classification scheme/
  Participant: Probably only the one directing the position 141. But remember that request comes with a rationale.
  Interviewer: So which one needs to be turned into a request?
  Participant: Simple rationale.
  Interviewer: So that’s Knowledge and request?
  Interviewer: That’s probably a request + Knowledge. “I have a reason for asking that, but I’m asking you to get a noun 37.” Yeah, it’s a request. You might almost say that the noun 97 database is requesting. “I’ve got this hole in my DB, where’s the Data? Send me this number.”
  Interviewer: Who is the DB requesting?
  Participant: noun 97 Noun 4 or... It’ll send out flags if it....
  Interviewer: So Noun 4 get a request flag?
  Participant: Yep. I need a number to fill this box in the DB.
  Interviewer: Fill request?
  Participant: Entry request. You might also get the same from switches. It probably is also interrogating swtiches. Switches are also effecitvely a request.
  Interviewer: This request, does it have a different label or is it the same flow?
  Participant: The same sort of flow. Say the same flow. We’re getting too complicated.
  Interviewer: Over here, day by day reports, Information+D+K. Line group 130 sends back directives which are requests. It also sends back questions? are they directions?
  Participant: they’re questions too.
  Interviewer: Is that a separate flow?
  Participant: I think it probably is. “I need to know all about this.” as distinct from “You will make sure that this is being done.” “I would like to know about this.” slightly different.
  Interviewer: These questions are Data, Information, Knowledge, Request, Other?
  Participant: I’d say it’s just request. There’s probably some Knowledge involved in making that request, but it’s not transmitted in making that request. Because the link to here: there’s soemthing going on here that triggers some of these requests.
  Interviewer: So let’s model that.
  Participant: This is starting to get... this is conjecture. Beyond the simplistic bits here and to the developmnet, this, you can only surmise what is going on.
  Interviewer: So you believe that group 142 has a flow to line group 130, via secretaries or direct?
  Participant: Direct. Because these meet the noun 97 people, usually once a day if not more. These people will probably have a meeting once a week or they may do the walk around and actually go and see people. That’s getting rarer and rarer too.
  Interviewer: group 142 to line group 130, what’s the flow there?
  Participant: I think there’s flows in both directions, reporting on condition, “this week we made X number of tons, our ... production rate was such and such,” reporting. Usually about weekly is my sense. “You can’t see him, he’s going to the weekly meeting, or gone to a business meeting.”
  Interviewer: So weekly reporting is a flow of?
  Participant: Probably more Information than anything else. The Data has dropped out of it. We’re now starting to just give the summary. Yes it is numbers, but we’ve reduced... it’s aggregation. I’ve reduced ten  thousand individual data points into one number. All the analyses ... and there’s probably three or four hundred analyses. “The average fill rate was such and such. Our target was such and such. We’re below target, we’re above target. Why? Why?” It is now Information. The Data, the hard numerics, is gone. That number embodies the Information. Slightly probably different sense of...
  Interviewer: but it’s an important difference. group 142 to line group 130 sends what?
  Participant: Probably the requests again. And the high level business Information. Request: I want noun 143 to be instiuted in the melters. noun 143 is a new managmenent in [company]. Basically it’s “no paper on your desk at the end of the day.” You have a clean office, everything in its place. Have you ever seen a technical person that isn’t mounded up with paper? Me, I want to walk out the end of the day: “That’s where I got to this day.”
  Interviewer: It’s an external memory.
  Participant: Bingo. I sit down. Alright, neurons start firing, we’re back into it. This probably comes from the phone center approach, where you don’t have the same desk every day. Wherever the phone is, that’s where your job is. You have a clean desk. I think that’s where it comes from. “You will institute noun 143 at the mine site” It’s a directive, it comes down, it has to be done.
  Interviewer: So basically what you do is you have a desk for managemnet then you have an informal paper center?
  Participant: we have another place where we actually go and work.
  Interviewer: High level business directives? What would you use?
  Participant: Directives that are coming down from further up the pyramid. There is also the Information. That would be the business Information. Kind of the last month, we’ve broken even. We’ve made a profit, we’ve made a loss, this has been the lossmaking area, so it’s that etherial business Information. And the people down, once you get beyond the line position 41. “What’s that all mean? What does it mean on a day to day basis?” Very very hard to see.
  Interviewer: This high level business Information is...
  Participant: I think it’s Information. Is it Knowledge? No, I don’t think it is. It’s just got an immediacy to it. And people who just basically do what they’re told. The board has said this, we will do this. I don’t care how you implement it. I want want this done. It’s Information and requests, the Knowledge is probably very very subsidary. ...
  Interviewer: Other flows?
  Participant: noun 129 to, we talked about this one.
  Interviewer: Are there ones besides that?
  Participant: noun 129 which is where I am, yes, I do have a line to there in the normal course of business . And in my current sort of job, I have  links to here to. Bing, bing, usually, because to see him, I’ve got to go through [name].
  Interviewer: noun 129 to position 144 sends what?
  Participant: I send, it’s a distilled version of Knowledge, Information, and Data.
  Interviewer: So you send a distillation...
  Participant: I send a distillation embodying all of those things.
  Interviewer: Distallation of what though?
  Participant: The Data. I’m telling a story about...
  Interviewer: We’re going to say story.
  Participant: A story, a specific problem, event, a series...
  Interviewer: This story is Data + Information + Knowledge?
  Participant: It’s Data, Information, and Knowledge. It’s built up from my experience. It extracts Data, or it has a Data component, and I’m reducing it to some sort of Information. But they’re not independant.
  Interviewer: Does line group 130 send anything to you?
  Participant: Yes, it also sends directives as to what it... “I like this piece of Information, can you do more?”
  Interviewer: Research directives?
  Participant: Yeah. We have this problem, can you look at it? That sort of thing. They don’t know what the solution is or what you can do about it. “That report, can you do a photocopy of that too, and can you send it to someone else? Has this position 41 been included in the circulation of this?” They are, what you say, organizational directives and directions in which way to produce investigations. “Yes, we like that idea, can you do any more.” That’s the one you want to hear and the one you hear the least of.
  Interviewer: These organzational and research directives are...
  Participant: Usually requests. And sometimes there’s Information.
  Interviewer: Is it Requests + Information, or just requests?
  Participant: Requests + Information but requests dominates. Requests &gt; Information. I think that’s a fair summary.
  Interviewer: noun 129 to position 145..
  Participant: is a request for an audience. “I need to talk to [name] about such and such” or “[name] wants to see you.”
  Interviewer: So they are sending back to you a request for audience as well?
  Participant: Yes.
  Interviewer: So it’s a bidirectional flow.
  Participant: Bidirectional, yes. But it’s only to get to see them. There’s no Knowledge, Information, or Data, in that statement.
  Interviewer: So it’s a request flow for...
  Participant: a request flow for audience.
  Interviewer: So it’s audience and type fo flow is reuqest. Then position 145 to group 142 send what?
  Participant: They usually look at their microsoft diary and see wher you’ve got to get.
  Interviewer: So the position 145 send the position 130 their schedule.
  Participant: “You’ve got a gap there, [name]” “Yeah, I suppose so.” It’s that sort of...
  Interviewer: this schedule is...
  Participant: Information.
  Interviewer: group 142 to noun 129 sends?
  Participant: I think it’s like the position 144. It’s usually requests and Information. Usually the Information flow is large to them. So we’re communicating what we’re finding...
  Interviewer: Findings?
  Participant: Yep, yep. Where we are in the project. It’s a distallation, it’s the story.
  Interviewer: These findings are?
  Participant: Primarily Information.
  Interviewer: Then group 142 to you sends?
  Participant: Probably requests and Information. Requests: “Look, this looks alright, we don’t want you to do any more on that, we want you to this.” Or, atlernatively, “Did you know that someone else is doing this and, you really should talk to them.” So it’s a blurring of the two, but usually, if they’re happy with which way you’re going, whether they support it or keep going. It’s the Do/Don’t Do type...
  Interviewer: So this flow is labeleld... direction?
  Participant: Direction and Information. “That’s very interesting but.”
  Interviewer: Direction?
  Participant: Yes, Direction. And the Information is: “Have you considered this?”
  Interviewer: but that’s a function of direction?
  Participant: Yes “We would like you to do this.” Effectively it’s Information, but really it’s probably another form of request to do something.
  Interviewer: Shareholders.
  Participant: There’re so far into the aether. But really it’s feeding through this line here. I think the Information is that way, as far as the technical is... If you have a look at the report... you know ...
  Interviewer: Report?
  Participant: Annual reports. Have a look at the [company] annual reports and you’ll see there’s a little sphiel about their technology side of things. ... It’s part of our corporate profile and it gets a couple of pictures. In the report it’s usually half a page. It’s saying we’re doing these sorts of things, we’re looking at these problmes. We’re trying to be proactive in terms of the environment. All those sorts of things.
  Interviewer: Do the shareholders send anything back?
  Participant: Only if the business goes bad.
  Interviewer: So it’s just a one way flow.
  Participant: Question, has a shareholder said anything of a technical nature that has registered with the board? I don’t think so. Only if a noun 97 is going really bad. ... But it’s probably only a thousandth of a percent of what the shareholders are communicating about. Insitutional shareholders, it’s about the state of the business . But sometimes things will pop up. But it’s only a small dotted line.
  Interviewer: Technical question, concern?
  Participant: Someone’s see something, someone’s asked the question. Some of those things might be via investor relations, and you really don’t know. But every organization has an investor relations.
  Interviewer: It’s?
  Participant: They’re probably trading on Knowledge,
  Interviewer: So they’re sending Knowledge?
  Participant: No, tehy’re using their Knowledge to generate a question/ request.
  Interviewer: So therefore, it’s a request?
  Participant: More a request.
  Interviewer: Do we have any flows that we’re missing?
  Participant: At this stage, I don’t know.
  Interviewer: The sum of rationale, activities, experiences, learning, and observation create Knowledge?
  Participant: Yes.
  Interviewer: Let’s have Information, Data, Knowledge, Request. What goes into Information?
  Participant: Information is, It’s the technical story. It’s usually is... business Information, what’s the state of the business ? In a technical sense, Information is a distallation of these entities here.
  Interviewer: Therefore it distills Knowledge?
  Participant: It takes Knowledge, Data, observations...
  Interviewer: Is that separate from Knowledge observations?
  Participant: Observations build into Knowledge.
  Interviewer: So Knowledge + Data... is there a function here that turns it into Information?
  Participant: usually my brain.
  Interviewer: Your brain doing?
  Participant: Generating the Information is like a jigsaw puzzle.
  Interviewer: You take what and combine it with what?
  Participant: You take Data and Knowledge and merging the two to generate Information. And it’s an incomplete set. These are incomplete sets.
  Interviewer: So you have Knowledge and Data create Information. Is it equality or directionality. Can information be unsausaged?
  Participant: Sometimes yes. You want to deconstruct the Information to get back tot he original concepts. So I take this Information and plot it. There is equality.
  Interviewer: Whereas with Knowledge you take this and go.
  Participant: Yep. Given that these are adding to it all the time.
  Interviewer: This sigma is adding to Knowledge all the time?
  Participant: Yes. I’ve found out this, and I’m going.
  Interviewer: Data is?
  Participant: Usually one off.
  Interviewer: This, but no sigma?
  Participant: Data is the hard numerical material to my way of thinking. It’s the experimental measurements, it’s the noun 97 measurements. It’s the chemical analyses. It’s the things that I can get which are hard. A number which has a physical association, or a variable association. It represents some property.
  Interviewer: Does Knowledge, Information or Request have any fuction in Data? Or is it just an experimental measurement?
  Participant: It’s just the experimental measurement.
  Interviewer: We have experimentaal measurements. wE combine experimental measurements with Knowledge to create Information. We have these perceptive things which are aggregated to create Knowledge.
  Participant: Yes. And the request is “We want you to look at these things.” The request brings into play all those factors.
  Interviewer: So a request is a one way function of Information, Data, and Knowledge?
  Participant: Yes. You are asked, or you ask yourself, “I would like to know about this.” And then the higher factors come into play. “How do I get an answer out of this problem? “and it’s the jigsaw puzzle. Consider a 500 piece jigsaw puzzle. For most of our games, we’re making the story on about 25 pieces of Information. In a really really good situation we might have 100 pieces to actually put the story toghether. But usually, because it’s in a business nature, we’ve only got 5
  Interviewer: Woudl you say that this accurately corresponds to what you consider the ontology of Data, Information, and Knowledge?
  Participant: I think it’s pretty close.</delimited>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 <float detail='figure' reference='fig:i2' location='aut:174'>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   <floatcontent><image name='i10.pdf' path='Chapter4/graphs'/></floatcontent>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   <floatcaption>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     <floattag>Figure 7.13:</floattag>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       <floattext>The SDFN Diagram for Interview 10  </floattext>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   </floatcaption>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 </float>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      <section detail='chapter' location='aut:175'>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   <sectionnumber>8</sectionnumber>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     <sectiontitle>Personal Reflections</sectiontitle>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     <sectioncontent> This chapter presents an the analysis of the evidence gathered by my interviews and surveys. I will explore whether or not my methodologies have demonstrated different conceptions of data and if they are capable of exploring unique realities of data in the first place.
  The initial discussion is an examination of my research paradigm and approaches, looking at the philosophical basis of my conclusions. I employ an abductive<link><descriptionsymbol detail='footnote'><m:math><m:mrow><m:mo>*</m:mo></m:mrow></m:math></descriptionsymbol></link> approach to iteratively define universes of interest, rather than applying inductive or deductive approaches.
  I am testing two questions of interest, which guide the course of my analysis: whether people have different realities of data and whether my methodologies can discover someone’s personal construction of data. By guiding the abductive research process with these two questions of interest, I may be able to limit my conclusions to the most simple and credible story possible from the evidence.

interview description will be written in strong language with categorical statements about the nature of data, information, and knowledge. These are my observations and interpretations from what the participants stated as refined through recursive analysis, not my own philosophies. Further testing is required before these statements can be codified into any kind of statement covering many people’s constructions of data. As one of the end products  of my methodologies is a person-specific understanding for the interviewer to the participant, I feel that these analyses will capture that specific understanding and already provide a useful tool for any designers of databases or interfaces who want to use my methodologies.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   <section detail='subsection' location='aut:182'>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   <sectionnumber>8.3.1</sectionnumber>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     <sectiontitle>Data as Communications</sectiontitle>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     <sectioncontent> One of the three constructions of data is that data are encoded signs. Signs that exist on paper or electronically are passed between humans who may then interpret those signs as data for information or knowledge encoded into them. In this construction, data is a technological artifact rather than something generated and manipulated by humans. Information and knowledge are passed using data, but are not of the same fundamental nature. The relationship is a container metaphor rather than hierarchical.
  The few interviews expounding upon this construction suggest that significant research is necessary to explore its tenets. Beyond that, there is some evidence that this construction may be held as a secondary way of understanding data when dealing with technological systems<link><descriptionsymbol detail='footnote'><m:math><m:mrow><m:mo>*</m:mo></m:mrow></m:math></descriptionsymbol></link> rather than as a fully-fledged construction of data of its own.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       <section detail='subsubsection' reference='Interview I' location='aut:184'>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       <sectionnumber>8.3.1.1</sectionnumber>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         <sectiontitle>Interview I</sectiontitle>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         <sectioncontent>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         <float detail='marginfigure'>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           <floatcontent>Technical pilot interview, exploring a Facebook game.

In this interview, the participant and I explored the leadership dynamics of a Facebook Game. More details about the SDFN diagram and its analysis can be found in chapter 3, in the case  study. This first interview will offer the raw quotes, as well as the recursive analysis appropriate to the section in which the quote appears, thanks to explicit permission by participant.
  Data, information, and knowledge relate to each other. Data is a menial category between these three. Data exists only as itself, without reliance on anything else. <delimited detail='quotation'>“Anything else”</delimited>  here means external signs which frame, or contextualize, data as well as indications that the data requires judgment or discernment on the part of the recipient. I believe that the participant considers the application of context to be something required of ambiguity or importance, and therefore of increased importance.
  Data is not a function of expertise or knowledge. A critical component of data is its lack of necessary arbitration: data is intuitively obvious, objective, and unimportant. <delimited detail='extract'>Participant: It’s almost like discrete packets.
  Interviewer: So, packets of?
  Participant: Data?
  Interviewer: Commands?
  Participant: Like a command. Saying: <delimited detail='quotation'>“I want to do something. I want rez the fort now.”</delimited>
 Interviewer: So is it OK to label this as commands, or does it encompass something other than commands?
  Participant: It does, sometimes...
  Interviewer: So commands and..
  Participant: No, that’s true. It’s pretty much just commands. Like I would send it I could do many things but they’re all related to telling the game to do something. I don’t call it knowledge, because it’s like it’s just, maybe they’re just talking about context thing. It’s something fairly simple, discrete. It’s not open for arbitration or anything like that. It doesn’t require arbitration, just <delimited detail='quotation'>“do it.”</delimited></delimited> Two iterations of analysis produce: <delimited detail='extract'>Data is discrete. Data does not need context nor arbitration. Commands to software are data. Data is simple, it can be executed on its own merits.</delimited> For example, instructions for action are data, both those that are explicit instructions to software agents and implicit orders as <delimited detail='quotation'>“status updates.”</delimited>  In the game sense, a  status update is a message sent out from administrators to the players <delimited detail='quotation'>“advising them”</delimited> on the status of the structure players are defending. This <delimited detail='quotation'>“advice,”</delimited>  however, is intended primarily as a mobilization for action, as positive activity is needed to create the structure.
  Communications are information. Communications are movements of subjective statements about the world encoded in the transmitted signs. Communications must have context. This categorization of data is used to delineate between communication/ information and data. Beyond a generalized context, communications must also contain a temporal context: they have to be about somewhen, whatever other elements they contain. <delimited detail='extract'>Participant: So I’m telling them, I’m sending them information. That they can now war. That they can start.
  Interviewer: And so this is a what? Is this a status, is this a command, is this something else?
  Participant: It’s information because it does require context. But it’s like a status it’s saying: <delimited detail='quotation'>“You can now war.”</delimited> We can start fighting.</delimited> Two iterations produce: <delimited detail='extract'>Information can be returned by software. Status is a form of information. There is a temporal aspect to changes in status.
  Information requires context. Information provides options.</delimited> Expertise is knowledge, being the perception of options for action in information. Knowledge confers the ability to be persuaded by communications as expertise is used to frame incoming information and thereby <delimited detail='quotation'>“understand”</delimited>  it. <delimited detail='extract'>Participant: I don’t know how to class their opinions. Not necessarily knowledge. It’s almost like data. It’s like, they don’t really send me commands, not as in the concept that we talked about, commands in the past that do something. It’s almost like data. They just tell me stuff. I’ll say, <delimited detail='quotation'>“We’re going to do this.”</delimited> but they’ll say, <delimited detail='quotation'>“I think we should do this.”</delimited> I don’t think I have to reply to it. It’s like they’re offering their opinion. But it’s where we’re distinguishing the different status. And then when we go to active clan masters. Now there’s a number of different inputs: <delimited detail='quotation'>“Clan status, Info, FB.”</delimited> Same with all of these. They’re in a group, they’re getting the same as everyone else. But we’ll have an  extra line which will definitely be MSN as well ... which will be another input to them.
  Interviewer: So you’re sending them MSN? And what are you sending over MSN?
  Participant: I don’t know? I can call it anything, can’t I? It’s like knowledge? I guess? It really is knowledge that I’m sending back to them that way. Similarly, they’ll send me back data and opinions via FB messaging. But they’ll also have that subsequent line via MSN. It’s that knowledge sharing. Even hilariously in the past, I’ve actually called some of these guys on the phone. ...
  Interviewer: Now what are you doing over this MSN &amp; Phone?
  Participant: Well, that’s the genuine sharing of knowledge. Knowledge of: <delimited detail='quotation'>“I think this; I want to do this; no, no, no, we can’t do that.”</delimited> It’s a collaborative sort of working together. It’s a sort of consensus-building. That’s where it’s knowledge, because by sharing that knowledge you can build a common consensus which we can work around. Because if we don’t share each other’s opinions or experiences then we never build the consensus to actually operate, otherwise you’d just be individuals because it, generally as a clan, we have to come up with a consensual view of everything..
  Interviewer: Do we want to have consensus as another line? Or is the sharing consensus-forming?
  Participant: Yeah, the sharing is consensus-forming. We exchange knowledge and out of that comes consensus. Even that knowledge is: <delimited detail='quotation'>“Do you consent to this?”</delimited> It’s not really a command but it’s a knowledge.</delimited> Two iterations produce: <delimited detail='extract'>Opinions, lacking privileged status, are not knowledge. Activity provides context. Responses from active members are classified as knowledge. Responses from semi-active and inactive leaders are data through opinions.
  Knowledge can be shared. Collaboratively sharing knowledge builds consensus.</delimited> There is no explicit differentiation between different kinds of data. There are examples in which data is either technical in nature (for example, a command to cause activity) or a communicative activity (wherein the communication was not produced as a function of expertise). Data is interesting only in the sense that it represents the mental activity of the communicator, not as any kind of thing on which to take action. The  differentiation only extends to the comment that something is <delimited detail='quotation'>“sort of data”</delimited>  potentially representing an internal cognitive dissonance between the two ideas. <delimited detail='extract'>Participant: It’s when you’re talking to another person and they’re passing their knowledge of what happened to them and what happened in the past to you. So you can either learn from your own experience or other’s experience. It’s really a mixture of that. In relation to knowledge gathering.
  Interviewer: Would you say that there’s any relationship between knowledge and data in this sense? Or is it just...
  Participant: No, I don’t... I think. I think the expression of data in this context, it’s interesting actually. Now you’ve got me thinking. No, but yes. Yes, but no. Well, it is sort of, yes. I agree. I don’t often express some things like certain relations to [the game] as data. but there definitely is if you stop and think about it, because. But yes.</delimited> Two iterations produce: <delimited detail='extract'>Knowledge can be gained from talking to other people, learning things through the game. Experiential Knowledge is what you get from doing things. You learn from criticism, experimentation, failure. A different kind of knowledge is someone else’s experience. Knowledge is privileged over data. Represents <delimited detail='quotation'>“knowing”</delimited> over "observation.</delimited> There was no discussion on transformations of data. Moreover, no conclusions can be drawn from inference, as it is equally likely that no transformative framework exists such that the standard hierarchy is present. Each term seemed to be discussed on its own merits without reference to the others. There are two constructions of data found here: data as a menial-interpersonal communication and data as a menial-technical communication. In both senses, data contains no privilege over information or knowledge. As menial-technical, data seems to be considered to be bits or human instructions rendered as bits: self-encapsulating orders for action. As menial-interpersonal, data seems to  be expressed observations of the world without a knowledge basis: empty words to be corrected and brought in line with the consensus formed by more experienced people.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           <section detail='subsubsection' location='aut:185'>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           <sectionnumber>8.3.1.2</sectionnumber>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             <sectiontitle>Interview II</sectiontitle>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             <sectioncontent>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             <float detail='marginfigure'>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               <floatcontent>The participant is an information worker.

Data is a container for human-produced information. Information and knowledge relate to each other as a function of human interpretation, integration, and analysis. The main function of data is as a communicative medium of technology.
  There is no hierarchy or relationship between data and information. Data is completely different from information or knowledge. <delimited detail='extract'>Data does not belong in the hierarchy of Information or Knowledge.
  The results of a search are Knowledge, but are formatted and contained within Data.</delimited> These quotes indicate a strong differentiation between information/knowledge and a strongly physicalized data. Although information and knowledge are related, the relationship expressed seems to be a function of analysis and encoding.
  Communications between people, as discussed in the interview, are clearly information. <delimited detail='extract'>Information is non-physical. It can be a communication, a conversation, a story.</delimited> Knowledge, or personal experience, is encoded in information for transmission to other people. This ontology requires this encoding because knowledge is not directly communicable between people. Knowledge guides interpretation of information and, in the case of knowledge encoded in information, the recipient’s knowledge must be used to analyze the incoming information-communication to produce new knowledge:  <delimited detail='extract'>Knowledge is associated with an experience. Information doesn’t have to be read or analyzed. Knowledge must be analyzed and used.</delimited> Data is a container for human-produced information stored in physicalized entities such as books or computers: <delimited detail='extract'>Data is a record that can record and contain Information. Records, Data, are merely physical entities.</delimited> As examples of data, the participant offers: <delimited detail='quotation'>“Physical containers are pieces of paper or e-mail. Digital containers are still physical.”</delimited>  With no evidence for other interpretations. In a simple sense, the participant believes that: <delimited detail='quotation'>“Data is a bucket for Information and Knowledge.”</delimited>  To restate: data is a semiotic representation of and container for content.
  Data as semiotic container is a strong ontological stake. It expands beyond the simple data-as-bits construction that may accompany other realities of <delimited detail='quotation'>“real”</delimited>  or <delimited detail='quotation'>“raw”</delimited> data. The universal application of data-as-container and information as root-of-meaning suggests that this construction extends beyond a simple communicative reality that can be used in conjunction with other constructions. Rather, it strictly defines a role for data in the storage of signs and relegates it to a strictly supportive role with respect to meaning. Nor does this construction leave any room for data as observation or numerical representation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               <section detail='subsection' location='aut:186'>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               <sectionnumber>8.3.2</sectionnumber>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 <sectiontitle>Data as Subjective Observations</sectiontitle>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 <sectioncontent> The next interviews explore the nature of data as a subjective observation. These constructions differ strikingly from the data-as-communications realities as they accord data a place in the knowledge/information/data hierarchy. There is evidence of Ackoff’s hierarchy in interview III that contrasts with a more cyclic hierarchy in interview IV.
  Present in both interviews is the acknowledgment that data is inherently subjective, that it is produced from observations made by people, and that it must be contextualized  with information to provide useful guidance. Data’s lack of inherent value due to its subjectivity requires that it be <delimited detail='quotation'>“filtered”</delimited> so that only the most usable aspects remain.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   <section detail='subsubsection' location='aut:187'>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   <sectionnumber>8.3.2.1</sectionnumber>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     <sectiontitle>Interview III</sectiontitle>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     <sectioncontent>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     <float detail='marginfigure'>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       <floatcontent>The participant explored business dynamics of a meeting.

While most of the other interviews focused on more technical topics, the communicative/business focus of this discussion provided an interesting counterpoint to the other interviews featured in the rest of this analysis. Observation is the fundamental component of data, allowing interpreted data to be useful information. Information becomes knowledge, with the hierarchy continuing beyond knowledge: <delimited detail='extract'>Knowledge is probably not the top of the hierarchy. Universal truths, e.g. things called <delimited detail='quotation'>“Laws”</delimited> in science, could be called wisdom (W).</delimited> In the interview, the participant began with a discussion of their opinion of the relationships between data, information, and knowledge. Later in the interview, however, they admitted to a change of their preconceptions due to the interview: <delimited detail='quotation'>“I consider [data and information] to be a hierarchy, but it’s not very clear in my mind”</delimited>  is a comment made by participant at the start of the interview. Later in the interview, the participant observed that participation in the <synonym detail='abbreviation' tag='SDFN'>SDFN</synonym> produced a change of understanding of data: <delimited detail='extract'>Coming into this interview, I thought that the hierarchy was Data, Information, Knowledge with maybe Wisdom or something above that. Or something crazy like that. Way out there. During the meeting, I think I... with your... non-directional coaching, you helped me to see where things were probably Data, where those Data were used by others to form Information. And then, pieces of Information, there’s something higher above information.</delimited> Structured and organized data, as delivered for a persuasive argument, becomes in  formation. Data can be transformed into knowledge directly, such as a scientist predicting movement with Newton’s first law of motion. In a prediction of the future as information, the predictor has to take data (observations of something happening), and input them into knowledge (a scientific model). Interestingly, data also encodes information and knowledge as well as forming the basis of those two concepts.
  Knowledge is the theoretical basis of understanding-of-the-world. Two people discussing a simple mechanical operation are communicating information, but the theory driving that discussion is knowledge. Furthermore, the jargon used in that discussion also represents knowledge, whereas a generalized description is <delimited detail='quotation'>“somewhere between data and information.”</delimited>  Thus, an understanding of the state of the art and the status quo is knowledge of what is possible or effective to do. Operation of effective management practices is also knowledge, despite the management theories themselves not being transmitted. Because the knowledge of effective management inspired the communications to modify behavior, the communications themselves are knowledge, representing the practice of those theories.
  Information is data structured for a purpose. Structured, organized data as delivered for a persuasive argument becomes information just as an historical-relationship context is also information structured for purpose. Data becomes information by a person or machine collecting data and then <delimited detail='quotation'>“drawing something out of it.”</delimited>  Just as information is a structuring of data, the participant suggests that knowledge may be a structuring of information.
  Data is an observation. A listing of daily events is a data flow just as a progress update is data. Nonverbal cues between people across a meeting table, such as eye contact or arm movement, also constitute data. When one of the meeting participants aggregates the nonverbal cues to supplement persuasive mechanisms, the participant considers  that aggregation to be data.
  Another example of data is an intuitive insight, a <delimited detail='quotation'>“moment of clarity,”</delimited>  into the fundamental nature of a problem. <delimited detail='quotation'>“Data gathering”</delimited>  is used in the context of an experiment differently than the term <delimited detail='quotation'>“data”</delimited>  alone, with few relationships in common between the two. <delimited detail='quotation'>“Experimental data”</delimited> , unlike normal <delimited detail='quotation'>“data”</delimited> , can have different levels of quality: <delimited detail='quotation'>“we can classify the data better if we can see it clearer.”</delimited>  There seems to be little support for data as encoded information or knowledge.
  The resolution of cognitive dissonance in this interview suggests that the <synonym detail='abbreviation' tag='SDFN'>SDFN</synonym>  can be used as a way to reconcile a participant’s theoretical understandings of categories with their everyday use. This consequence, while useful in the exploration of philosophy, can also be useful as a practical way to resolve <delimited detail='quotation'>“silos”</delimited>  as it is a way to change a participant’s understanding of the items under discussion.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       <section detail='subsubsection' reference='Interview IV' location='aut:188'>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       <sectionnumber>8.3.2.2</sectionnumber>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         <sectiontitle>Interview IV</sectiontitle>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         <sectioncontent>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         <float detail='marginfigure'>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           <floatcontent>The participant is an engineer.

There is a cyclic hierarchy of data as observations, localized by information, and filtered by knowledge, becoming information and knowledge. Knowledge then directs the gathering of the next cycle of information. There are no obvious demographic characteristics to explain the strong subjective nature of this participant’s views, though they seemed to engage more strongly with databases than did those of some of the other participants.
  Data is used both in singular and plural senses, data can have qualities, and measurement generates a data point. Data relates to information and knowledge in a cyclic  hierarchy<link><descriptionsymbol detail='footnote'><m:math><m:mrow><m:mo>*</m:mo></m:mrow></m:math></descriptionsymbol></link> , such that some assertions about the world (knowledge) form a context within which to view data. <delimited detail='quotation'>“Knowledge filters data, which produces information, which produces knowledge. The acceptance of new knowledge is predicated on extant filters.”</delimited> One example of context modulating the nature of data is the understanding of a sensor’s purpose changing the observer’s interpretation of the data produced by that sensor. In this understanding, background education is a primary contributor to a piece of data’s context.
  Information’s localization of data from the <delimited detail='quotation'>“study of the issue at hand”</delimited>  helps the recipient to understand what the data means. Information emerges from a contextualization of data: <delimited detail='quotation'>“In order to have context [within] which to understand data, background education (knowledge) and the study of the problem at hand (information) must be combined.”</delimited>  Knowledge and information represent different levels of understanding, with knowledge formed by integrated conclusions versus the ordered and contextualized data of information.
  Understanding in this case is an awareness of applicability. All data, information, and knowledge interact with mental models of the worlds. Locally true items are information, whereas knowledge informs models that are more global. Because the generation of knowledge is a function of incoming filtered data, we sometimes get conflicts in explanations: <delimited detail='extract'>Explanation is contextualizing [models] for specific circumstances. Explanations should expand knowledge. Sometimes they contradict understanding, potentially due to cultural factors or mistranslation.</delimited> Knowledge filters for meaningful data, and data is contextualized from information into information. Contextualizing knowledge frameworks allow for an understanding of incoming data by situating that data within knowledge. The framework does so by                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          <description detail='footnote'>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           <descriptiontag><link><m:math><m:mrow><m:mo>*</m:mo></m:mrow></m:math></link></descriptiontag>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           <descriptioncontent>Reminiscent of Tuomi’s ontology (page <link destination='Tuomi' location='aut:63'>28</link> ).  </descriptioncontent>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         </description>  providing a relevancy filter for incoming data: <delimited detail='extract'>Information is more concrete -- in the hierarchy. Data is concrete. I measured it via a defined process at a particular time. We might argue what it means, which is knowledge, but it is what it is. But the information ... I’ve reviewed a whole pile of things. Those are information sources, it’s clear how I obtained them. They may be wrong, their provenance may not be certain. Data is specific, discrete. Information can be a collection of data.</delimited> It is the process of collecting and localizing data which turns data into information. This set of localized data is contextualized, which increases relevance at the same time that it increases potential error or subjectivity. Despite claims of concrete data, data in this construction must be subjective: it is filtered from human observations. However, the self-reflection of that subjectivity creates meta-data about reliability and thereby filters for useful data.
  Data is a discrete observation. Discrete data means the ability to specify <delimited detail='quotation'>“what, where, when: would define a piece of that, what the measure of it was, and its location at the time.”</delimited>  Data has a specific provenance and reliability. Data is treated as if it is atomic, despite the ability to perform different, closer observations of the same thing. The presence of the term <delimited detail='quotation'>“filter,”</delimited>  one of the most important keywords that I found, suggests that data as observation is produced from any observation of the world and is thus a subjective construction, tied to the observer, rather than evidence of the world.
  Meaning is produced through the negative feedback of knowledge. Data can be formed into data sets, which may be evidence of a somewhat local scientific language translating between purely subjective data and the <delimited detail='quotation'>“reliable”</delimited>  data that some scientists demand. Relationships between sets are information.
  There is no link to technical data in this construction. Representations of data (bits) are not the thing. Categories of representations are meta-data and bit streams are merely representations of data. <delimited detail='quotation'>“When people can attach meaning to bit-streams, they  can become information. Normally glyphs become information, but when they’re just representations of data (like the ’A’ signifying a part of the base pair in DNA) they’re still data.”</delimited>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           <section detail='subsection' location='aut:190'>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           <sectionnumber>8.3.3</sectionnumber>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             <sectiontitle>Data as Facts</sectiontitle>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             <sectioncontent> Conceptions of data in this category tend to be more scientifically oriented, representing data as only the results of careful consideration and measurement. Here, data as facts orient the observer to a recorder-of-measurements, rather than as someone who must filter observations or interpret semiotic encodings.
  This category of interviews is the largest, as can be expected while interviewing a scientific research establishment; because of the scope of the interviews, I probably missed some significant nuances.

The participant is a highly theoretical researcher, in contrast with some of the more pragmatically trained participants. Data are specific and measured observations.
  Data, information, and knowledge are ordered categorically in terms of precision. Information is an unconfirmed interpretation of data and knowledge represents understanding of the real world. The flow from specific to general is interesting, especially when considering the implications of the participant’s conception of data.
  Data are measured observations, with observations or raw measurements as <delimited detail='quotation'>“raw data,”</delimited>  and interpretations of data to be data-as-<delimited detail='quotation'>“interpreted data.”</delimited>  Experiments return data as numbers collected by various instruments, but data is also embodied in the world. Geometry and design of equipment and the operational set points are data. <delimited detail='quotation'>“Equipment geometry and operational set points are embodied data.”</delimited>  The idea of data embodied in the real is a strong feature of the data-as-facts construction.
  There must be an observer to manipulate things outside of data because, <delimited detail='quotation'>“[The] experiment itself is not a conscious entity; you cannot send anything but data to it.”</delimited>  While it is interesting to consider information and knowledge as functions of consciousness, the distinction between data as embodied or observed seems to belie my assessment of <delimited detail='quotation'>“data as measured observations.”</delimited>  If data is allowed to be embodied in the physical universe, then to retrieve the data and thereby to understand the object is to perform some sort of structured and measured observation in the context of an experiment. The participant notes that data are <delimited detail='quotation'>“raw numbers and no context.”</delimited>  This construction requires that data must be understood as the fundamental relationships of matter that can be observed and quantized.
  The category of information trades precision for context. Information is an unconfirmed interpretation of data. There is a clear distinction between the objectivity of data and the interpretation/necessary subjectivity of information. <delimited detail='extract'>It’s not just raw numbers ... but it’s not knowledge because it’s the experiment and a very contrived environment.... It is interpreted data about the contrived environment.</delimited> This interpreted data-as-information is not knowledge because it does not represent a phenomenon of the object under consideration. Data produced as part of a simple experiment, does not form the basis of action in the real metalworking area.
  Experimental information (or interpreted data) as the product of simple experi  ments may not conform to the real world. However, information may form the basis of understanding of the real world. Information, combined with a statement of <delimited detail='quotation'>“I think you should do this”</delimited>  (classified as knowledge) may allow design engineers to create new designs. Flows of information wholly contain <delimited detail='quotation'>“raw data”</delimited><link><descriptionsymbol detail='footnote'><m:math><m:mrow><m:mo>*</m:mo></m:mrow></m:math></descriptionsymbol></link>  and its explanation, whereas an independent flow of data would be subject to external interpretation.
  Knowledge is an understanding of the real world. It may be formed from personal experience, but may not be about <delimited detail='quotation'>“unreal things.”</delimited>  An unreal thing is <delimited detail='quotation'>“Information, because it’s not a real thing yet.

They explore the implications of computerized data. However, in contrast with other interviewed information workers, they clearly articulate data to be facts exported from measuring instruments. Although there are elements of contextualization here, the view of data as records of measurements indicates a different construction of data when compared to the other information specialists<link><descriptionsymbol detail='footnote'><m:math><m:mrow><m:mi>†</m:mi></m:mrow></m:math></descriptionsymbol></link> . More research is necessary to explore how interactions with technical devices shape conceptions of data.

Knowledge contextualizes data (and the plot of data).
  Knowledge is a generalized statement about the world. Information is multidimensional data such as data versus time. The act of contextualizing data by forming data sets and comparing it against other parameters like time produces reports as <delimited detail='quotation'>“information.”</delimited> These reports are locally true, and may be explored for insights into trends and patterns (knowledge).
  Data produces information, which produces knowledge. Mathematical models are information, which complement experiential knowledge. However, models are useless without data as input. Information-as-model requires contextualization (knowledge) by a person to be useful: <delimited detail='quotation'>“People’s experience, as knowledge, tells them when to transform data into information into knowledge.”</delimited>  Thus, data is treated as if it is atomic, despite being decomposable in other contexts.
  Looking at the higher levels of the hierarchy, knowledge must be explicit and encodable (such as into source code), but it has fewer restrictions than information because information is less discrete. Data are components of information. People treat <delimited detail='quotation'>“derived data”</delimited>  as <delimited detail='quotation'>“real”</delimited>  despite knowledge that it has been processed. In the local jargon of the research environment, real seems to mean <delimited detail='quotation'>“authentic and an atomic representation of a measurement.”</delimited> Data are measured facts. They can be input to mathematical models, contextualized with information, and generalized with knowledge. They are created from sensors and bits. This construction clearly articulates Ackoff’s hierarchy of data, information, and knowledge, viewing data as unimportant building blocks in the path towards gener  alizable statements.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       <section detail='subsubsection' location='aut:195'>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       <sectionnumber>8.3.3.3</sectionnumber>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         <sectiontitle>Interview VII</sectiontitle>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         <sectioncontent>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         <float detail='marginfigure'>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           <floatcontent>The participant is a scientist.

Although data are also facts for participants, there exists an entity below data: the <delimited detail='quotation'>“data point”</delimited>  or specific measurement. Sets of data points become data, restricted purely to the numerical results of measurements.
  Data are numbers, and only numbers. <delimited detail='quotation'>“Data is a multi-dimensional collection of data points. A data point is a number.”</delimited>  As well as <delimited detail='quotation'>“Data plus analysis creates information. Analysis is a function of a mental causal model. Understanding of the model is knowledge.”</delimited>  The ultimate goal of data collection is the creation of knowledge as the basis of science.
  Information is the basis of action and a container for data: <delimited detail='quotation'>“Information are instructions to perform work of a specific nature, guidance into what it is they’re going to test.”</delimited>  Information is what allows humans to judge between different outcomes: to order one product over another because of scientific results contained within the information. Those results, interpreted and packaged, are data. Although the participant uses the container metaphor here, information is not acting as a passive sign-repository. Rather, the contextualization of information is explicitly differentiated from the pure numbers of data, rather than data being transformed into information.
  Data, analyzed into information, may create novel information. Novel information can generate knowledge. Knowledge is a predictive model of the universe, <delimited detail='quotation'>“based on generated meaning through interpreted results (information).”</delimited>  Knowledge as predictive  model is far superior in this hierarchy because of its generalizable quality, something that individual decisions to act do not contain. A meta-analysis of action, the results of acting on information received, can create meaning or knowledge: <delimited detail='extract'>Knowledge is a model derived from analysis of information. You analyze data and generate new information. New information can generate new models. Models are knowledge. A shift in [a] model (physical or whatever) is due to new knowledge from discussion.</delimited> This construction demonstrates Ackoff’s hierarchy <link><descriptionsymbol detail='footnote'><m:math><m:mrow><m:mo>*</m:mo></m:mrow></m:math></descriptionsymbol></link> , with the scope increasing as each level of abstraction is gained. Models, as the ultimate discussed step, represent knowledge, because they represent that which interprets incoming information. At the base of the hierarchy, however, rests data as facts measured into numbers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           <section detail='subsubsection' location='aut:197'>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           <sectionnumber>8.3.3.4</sectionnumber>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             <sectiontitle>Interview VIII</sectiontitle>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             <sectioncontent>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             <float detail='marginfigure'>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               <floatcontent>The participant is a researcher from a different company. Data are objective observations with no restriction on representation.

The interview was taken spontaneously while they were visiting the site on one of the days I conducted interviews. Data are rendered measurements. Unlike Interview VII, the measurements are not constrained to purely numerical entities, but require the same level of objective rigidity.
  In the interview, the participant did not discuss any hierarchy of data, information, or knowledge. While there seem to be strong verbal differences between data and the others, there are no transformations from data into information or knowledge. Information is understood quite differently from data or knowledge: <delimited detail='quotation'>“Information is a container for data and knowledge.”</delimited> Knowledge is transmittable experience: <delimited detail='quotation'>“Knowledge is perception of something, what you think you know.”</delimited>  Experience manifests as intuitions and requests for specific data are an expression of encoded knowledge. In one example, the participant transmits a request for an image to the database: <delimited detail='quotation'>“I would be sending that knowledge, even if the DB doesn’t acknowledge it.”</delimited>  Knowledge is transmitted in the act of using knowledge, despite the receiving components possibly not being able to understand that what they are receiving is indeed knowledge.
  Specific data retrieval is a function of knowledge. Because knowledge is present in the act of using knowledge, data requests to computing devices are formed from knowledge and therefore represent the sender’s knowledge, rather than the recipient’s received data. This represents an interesting meta-component of this conception of data, representing an explicit trading zone formed between entities sharing what one of them considers to be data.
  Information is a container. Bits are information and form the substance of the container. Beyond the container metaphor is also a question of quality: <delimited detail='extract'>Information is a quality. It mixes with data and knowledge. Something that you relate, it goes from one source to another. Any kind of data or knowledge is some kind of information.</delimited> Thus, information is more than a simple container, and may seem to be an intrinsic building block of data-knowledge interaction with the world. Information seems to equate to semiotic ideas, as it can be a representation or transmission agent. In strong contrast to the constructions of the data-as-communication camp, information is communication. Information, being formed of signs, requires interpretation for the extraction of the data and knowledge components of use to computers and humans, respectively.
  Data are factual representations of measurements. They usually form numbers, but, <delimited detail='quotation'>“Information is text and data is numbers, but even text could be data. Text as data  are descriptions of measurements.”</delimited>  The fundamental characteristic of data is that it is the factual product of experiment. At the same time, the participant also seems to use data-as-technical, because they describe punching in a few numbers to get a drawing as data as well.
  This interview represents a fascinating departure from the normal affordances expressed as it provides a strong definition of data and knowledge and a very weak, subsidiary, and technical view of information. One possible explanation is that, coming from another country’s cultural understandings, participant linked the term information to the computerized bits and had less experience with other uses of information. This interview, alone, suggests a strong need for an international investigation into the different cultural conceptions of data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               <section detail='subsubsection' location='aut:198'>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               <sectionnumber>8.3.3.5</sectionnumber>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 <sectiontitle>Interview IX</sectiontitle>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 <sectioncontent>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 <float detail='marginfigure'>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   <floatcontent>The participant is an engineer. Data are numbers that are orderable within a list.

In both frames of thought, participant describes data as something inherently numeric, with some basis in fact.
  Data, information, and knowledge relate in a cyclic hierarchy. Data interpreted via existing knowledge creates information. Information analyzed creates knowledge. There is a container metaphor in this construction of data as, <delimited detail='quotation'>“Information can appear alongside knowledge or as a component of knowledge.”</delimited>  As a practical example of this understanding: equipment returns data that is processed into information via an engineer. Analysis is then performed as to <delimited detail='quotation'>“whether things are working.”</delimited>  Information is produced  by an analysis of data.
  Knowledge is fundamentally experiential: <delimited detail='quotation'>“I would define knowledge as something that an individual or entity... something that an entity possesses. That typically has been learned from somewhere else or gained from experience or whatever that enables them a better understanding then they would have otherwise.”</delimited>  Knowledge as understanding represents knowledge as model, articulating the nature of the universe by making predictions about future events.
  Knowledge acts as the agent that transforms data into information: <delimited detail='extract'>My understanding of how things would work is that knowledge is the process by which data is turned into information. So I would say data is things. It is numbers, it is raw information. It is something that, on its own, doesn’t mean very much. It’s just stuff. Information is an interpretation of that. So it’s kind of something that is understandable to someone without knowledge, without even concept of what the raw data is.</delimited> Knowledge is understanding: advice about the causes of unexpected events. Knowledge can be communicated and the creation of understanding of the process under investigation is knowledge. Documentation contains knowledge because it presents a history of actions, and can provide methods for analyzing data. The analyzed data, in some ways the <delimited detail='quotation'>“understood data,”</delimited>  is collected in things like reports. The report, however, just contains facts about what was done and the results. <delimited detail='quotation'>“[Less meaningful] stuff is the information and the results are data.”</delimited> Data are numbers: <delimited detail='quotation'>“You can put them in a list. There is a defined quantity. They can be grouped, they can be ordered or whatever. They probably are data. You can put them in a spreadsheet.”</delimited>  However, the emphasis seems to be on numbers rather than on scientific results: not on the objectivity but on the coding mechanism. The participant believes that code is data: source code is instructions and numbers to work with.
  Information is connected with the communicative act. Facts are transmitted via  information, but there does not seem to be any evidence to indicate that facts are information, merely that information is the semiotic encoding [<link destination='1:Sperber1995' location='1:Sperber1995'>58</link> ] process by which they are communicated. Knowledge can be communicated through information. The recipient, in possession of this encoded knowledge, must then analyze the information to retrieve its knowledge component.
  In some ways, information described in this construction echoes the information as container construction of Interview VIII. While there is evidence of the participant’s cyclic hierarchy, there are interesting ambiguities relating to the relationship of information, <delimited detail='quotation'>“raw information”</delimited> , and facts. While data are encoded pre-facts expressed as numbers, this interview presents difficulties in classification and represents an edge case worthy of future research.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   <section detail='subsubsection' location='aut:200'>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   <sectionnumber>8.3.3.6</sectionnumber>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     <sectiontitle>Interview X</sectiontitle>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     <sectioncontent>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     <float detail='marginfigure'>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       <floatcontent>The participant is a researcher external to the company.

Their conception of data represents something with a strong sense of embodiment; data is physically present in the world, in relations between matter. Measurements and observations can discover data, but not create it out of subjective whole cloth.
  One of the more interesting concepts of the interview was that of formality. The idea of formality is raising a McLuhan-like <delimited detail='quotation'>“medium is the message”</delimited>  level of meta-analysis. It notes that the context of a communication and its source within an organization contribute significantly to the actions one takes upon it, despite the same communication being passed from different directions: <delimited detail='quotation'>“Information passed from knowledge won’t be turned into knowledge by the recipient due to a lack of formal power within the  organization. The information is just <delimited detail='quote'>‘the background why’</delimited> that doesn’t change actions.”</delimited> Formality, the coding of the <delimited detail='quotation'>“authority”</delimited>  encoded in the message’s medium, is something that modulates knowledge rather than a unique category to itself. Formality represents an actionable instance of whatever the category is. Written reports, delivered to responsible people in the organization, are an example of formal knowledge. They are incorporated into the organization’s stock of knowledge and acted upon. Those same reports delivered to interested parties, informally, do not have the same actionable qualities.
  Formal knowledge is an expression and transference of technical understanding. Components of the flow described by the participant include distilled and certified data sets, the analysis of those sets, and other supporting observational material. The certification of the data sets is to insure that the analysis is internally consistent. Certification is checking the fit of <delimited detail='quotation'>“internal guidelines of quality.”</delimited>  To designate something as certified is to express an opinion of its reliability and repeatability. Because of the additional process of certification, formal x can be acted upon. The participant believes that normal flows, lacking confirmation, are not processed in the same way.
  There is clear evidence for a reverse hierarchy in the interview. The Tuomi hierarchy suggests that we use knowledge to build information that allows us to extract data from the world; this data then allows us to update our models of the world. In this way, as information frames our requests for data (subjective or objective as they may be) it is possible to check the integrity of the data and contextualize it by inspecting the originating information. Experiments can be designed to extract information from sensors and computing devices operating on machinery. When sensors are rare, experiments are designed to maximize <delimited detail='quotation'>“reliable information from an experiment.”</delimited> Knowledge is expertise. Expertise, however, is expressed as an understanding of  the world that shapes action. The participant observes that <delimited detail='quotation'>“corridor conversations”</delimited> discussed in an informal setting can contain information and knowledge. Information, in this case, <delimited detail='quotation'>“is the things that I can reduce to something technical.”</delimited>  Knowledge <delimited detail='quotation'>“is their understanding of the process, how and why they turn levers and their perception of the basis of that.”</delimited>  Thus, as expertise accumulates from the past shared precedents of actions, events, and training, it acts as a guide to action. It informs information-gathering methodologies, which then inform data-collection strategies. The use of <delimited detail='quotation'>“reduce”</delimited>  in the quote above is better understood as <delimited detail='quotation'>“abstraction”</delimited>  rather than implying that information is <delimited detail='quotation'>“under”</delimited>  knowledge.
  Information has a temporal element or has a different level of reliability. Whereas more sensors, both cheaper and more connected, produce more data, the output of multiple sensors over time produces information. <delimited detail='quotation'>“In the context of the whole operating campaign, you don’t know the reliability of the information, you don’t see the built in trends... but you’ve got the data points. Three quarters of the data in the database, you don’t know how it was acquired.”</delimited>  Although information may appear to be used synonymously with data, there is a suggestion that a thing can be classified as data or information based on some kind of underlying or meta-characteristic.
  For example, a physical sample can embody both data and information, depending to whom it is sent. This suggests that observations and numbers are latent in the world. In this way, observation transforms latent information or data in the atomic or molecular structure of the thing being experimented upon into more easily recognizable numbers with defined error limits. This transformation is not an external imposition of measurement, but a recognition of something that is already there.
  Information is an observation of the world. Observations of physical nature are information assigned from parameters informed by knowledge as previous experience.  The participant strongly believes in the objectivity of information. They require that different types of measurements of the same object correspond. In this instance, a sample represents embodied information. There is no inherent knowledge of what it is in the object, but it is information. If the information is analyzed, it then can become data. In this vein, environmental observations surrounding the sample are information, creating a <delimited detail='quotation'>“picture of the problem.”</delimited>  Binary signals from switches can be information or data, depending on whether they represent state status (information) or measurements of quantities and masses.
  The apex of the hierarchy is data. Data are contextualized hard numbers. Data can be generated from <delimited detail='quotation'>“something you can reduce to a number. It has observations, but it’s reducible to a number.”</delimited>  Optimally, samples will be accompanied by recorded site observations, situating the sample in some sort of context.
  Unlike the other interviews, this one holds no indication that contextualization serves to transform the data into information. Instead, contextualization creates data that are more valuable. All things contain within them latent information that, through the correct experiments, may be observable. Only through analysis can the observed and recorded results be promoted to data. One method of analysis is a chemical analysis because the results of chemical analysis are deemed <delimited detail='quotation'>“real”</delimited>  and <delimited detail='quotation'>“hard data”</delimited>  numbers according to standards.
  At the same time, data has different natures according to the roles that need the data. <delimited detail='quotation'>“The geologist says I want the sample. The chemist says I want the analysis.”</delimited> The participant notes that for other roles, data’s substance can be process data or the discovery of relations within the set of process data.
  Data exist at various levels of accuracy. <delimited detail='quotation'>“Industrial quality”</delimited>  data has accuracy considerations different from those of academic or theoretical quality. Furthermore, dud  data-data that is erroneous-is possible and is a likely result of cost-saving measures.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       <section detail='subsection' location='aut:201'>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       <sectionnumber>8.3.4</sectionnumber>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         <sectiontitle>Reflection Conclusion</sectiontitle>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         <sectioncontent> My findings fundamentally agree with and extend both Chaim Zins’ work and the definitions of the Oxford English Dictionary.

This section documents the results of my second survey attempt and is a check on the  conclusions drawn from my interviews. Many different participants participated in this survey, being drawn from academics, <synonym detail='abbreviation' tag='IST'>IST</synonym> professionals, other workers at BlueScope, and intelligence workers from the United States civilian and military intelligence establishments.
  Survey analysis proceeds in a roughly straightforward fashion. I discuss interesting aspects of each incoming survey, and try to derive their conception of data by looking at how they classify data, information, and knowledge. Their classifications and the relationships they articulate between them may give some clue about each participant’s conceptions of data. Less time will be spent on each individual survey due to their less comprehensive nature. The terms <delimited detail='quotation'>“participant”</delimited> and the singular <delimited detail='quotation'>“they”</delimited> will continue to be used to indicate the survey-taker.
  These surveys were the first deployment of my survey methodology that resulted in any kind of success. As such, the instructions were not close to perfect, with a few survey- takers misunderstanding the instructions. I state this with certainty as one participant (name withheld, but permission given) had the following to say in an e-mail: <delimited detail='extract'>Also, I had a hard time with the questions. About midway through the survey, I realized that some of the questions were looking for a semantic understanding of the meaning of the highlighted words. I began the survey looking at it through an analyst’s eyes, with the understanding that data coming in only becomes information or knowledge if it reveals something about the intended target -- usually a person or group of people (network). As I went along, I realized that you were differentiating between data, information, and knowledge as semantic definitions that all described different types of incoming <delimited detail='quotation'>“media”</delimited> or <delimited detail='quotation'>“communications”</delimited>. I got the impression that you viewed data as something measurable, information as something that feeds understanding, and knowledge as something that is either factual or knowable. Since these are pretty disparate understandings of the terminology, it was difficult to reconcile my answers between the two methods of differentiating the data types.
  I offer this as perhaps an anecdotal story about the problems with this kind of question. Like so many issues surrounding understanding within a community (e.g., religious doctrine), the real question here is perhaps not so much a matter of different perceptions within  a subculture, but whether or not the subculture has taken the time to clearly define their terminology to enable effective communication. For more <delimited detail='quotation'>“tangible”</delimited> elements of conversation, like computer design, engineering, or medicine, the subcultures tend to build a sophisticated lexicon of industry jargon very quickly, because the objects described (whether processes, methods, tools, concepts, or physical things) are easy to understand. With subcultures that focus on more ambiguous topics (freedom, truth, spirituality, goodness, guilt, culpability), the clarity of their jargon becomes diluted by variation in understanding of the meanings of the subculture’s terminology. You (purposely?) do not define what information, data, and knowledge mean in your survey. Therefore, these terms will carry a wide variety of denotations and connotations with them. The implication is that effective communication within the intelligence subculture cannot begin until the subculture’s definition of these terms is made explicit.</delimited>
 Therefore, the products of this analysis should be taken with a grain of salt, and used to suggest that far more work can be done in this area, as opposed to presenting any kind of definitive or reproducible look at the reality of data.
  As stated in the methodology<link><descriptionsymbol detail='footnote'><m:math><m:mrow><m:mo>*</m:mo></m:mrow></m:math></descriptionsymbol></link>, the surveys allowed participants to self-identify by role and then classify a series of scenarios<link><descriptionsymbol detail='footnote'><m:math><m:mrow><m:mi>†</m:mi></m:mrow></m:math></descriptionsymbol></link> as to being data, information, knowledge, or other. The self-identification of role will be communicated in summarized form in each survey below. The summary will be generalized to preserve confidentiality. From each survey, I will abstract the most interesting explanations given of categorization. Included in each summary will also be a description of the general proportions of the answers. Each participant not only has their own conception of data, but their own rationale for identifying things as Data, Information, Knowledge, or Other. The analysis will also briefly touch on the nature of each participant’s categorizations of the Other, and how they may influence their construction of data.
  Each introductory paragraph will contain a count, as noted, of X data, Y information, and Z knowledge.

In addition, the number of surveys is not sufficiently high for any statistically useful generalizations. As ever, this research is just laying the foundation for more intensive research, and I feel that this survey structure could form the basis for an excellent long-term study of many people’s conceptions of data and how they change over time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               <section detail='subsection' reference='Survey I' location='aut:205'>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               <sectionnumber>8.4.1</sectionnumber>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 <sectiontitle>Survey I</sectiontitle>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 <sectioncontent> The participant is working in the database labs of a university. They classified most scenarios as information and knowledge, with the counts of the various classifications being: 3 Data, 11 Information, 10 Knowledge, and 2 Other. Participant was careful to classify other scenarios as a <delimited detail='quotation'>“lack of data”</delimited> and <delimited detail='quotation'>“ambiguous”</delimited> that increases the reliability of prior categorizations as it demonstrates that participant is not afraid of novel categorization.

 The participant presents a novel interpretation of data. One explanation of the unusual sense of symbol without meaning is that the participant’s role is sharply different when compared to the other interviews. Furthermore, when considered in light of databases, a purely technical understanding of data could support the symbol-without-meaning interpretation if the participant does not assign computers the ability to manipulate meaning.

 The notation of meaning in information has links with the information-as-communication theme found in some interviews above, but suggests a purely semiotic boundary: symbols-with-meaning versus symbols-without-meaning, without any kind of communicative subtext.

 This position is an interesting one to take, inasmuch as knowledge is a subset of information that relates to action or time. Knowledge is anything with practical meaning, or in other words, anything that is actionable.
  The participant belongs in the data-as-communications camp, assigning computers the role of data processors while granting a privileged human-centric view of information and knowledge as symbols with meaning (and utility). Although the relationships between data, information, and knowledge are unusual, they do not present any unexpected new conceptions of data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   <section detail='subsection' location='aut:206'>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   <sectionnumber>8.4.2</sectionnumber>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     <sectiontitle>Survey II</sectiontitle>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     <sectioncontent> The participant works for a defense department as an information processor. They present a strong bias towards classifying scenarios as data, with 11 as Data, 6 as Information, and 9 as Knowledge. They did not take advantage of the Other category. One hypothesis is that as an information processor they have a very strictly operationalized definition of information. Still, the lack of any categorization of Other suggests that Data or Knowledge were used as catchalls.
  Data is an unanalyzed sign, set of signs, or communication.

 While <delimited detail='quotation'>“data as a fundamental building block of information”</delimited> is unambiguous, the attached semiotic definition results in an uncertain hypothesis. The interesting phrase, <delimited detail='quotation'>“Lowest category of analysis,”</delimited> suggests a strict and articulated set of relationships among data, information, and knowledge. The very strictness of the hierarchy, of course, means that accessing it is quite difficult: much of the participant’s knowledge about data is tacit and assumed, making it difficult to extract from their explanations of reasoning.
  Information is analyzed data:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      <itemgroup detail='itemize'>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       <item>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         <itemtag><m:math><m:mrow><m:mo>•</m:mo></m:mrow></m:math></itemtag>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         <itemcontent><delimited detail='quotation'>“The data of how the user interface worked is changed to information by the analysis of the users, categorizing things into <delimited detail='quote'>‘good,’</delimited> <delimited detail='quote'>‘bad,’</delimited> <delimited detail='quote'>‘useful,’</delimited> etc. However, this does not include recommendations for action, and so doesn’t quite go as far as knowledge.”</delimited></itemcontent>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         </item>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       <item>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         <itemtag><m:math><m:mrow><m:mo>•</m:mo></m:mrow></m:math></itemtag>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         <itemcontent><delimited detail='quotation'>“Quotes are chosen to reflect a given point, and so are offered with inherent analysis, by the questioner, the respondent, or both. ”  </delimited></itemcontent>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       </item>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       <item>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         <itemtag><m:math><m:mrow><m:mo>•</m:mo></m:mrow></m:math></itemtag>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         <itemcontent><delimited detail='quotation'>“Poetry, while perhaps not designed as traditional analysis, does offer insight, and information-at least about the poet.

 Analysis of data creates information. However, if we explore the meaning beyond analyzed data, defining the term becomes quite tricky. It is easy to exclude knowledge as actionable information, but the very specificity of the term <delimited detail='quotation'>“analyzed data”</delimited> precludes most understanding. In some ways, the meaning of information could be as broad as information as statements about nouns in the world.
  Knowledge is information applied to decision making. In many ways, this classification echoes the knowledge of Survey I.

 As knowledge is applied information (similar to Survey I), knowledge must be actionable information. This relationship is a reasonable derivation of Ackoff’s hierarchy, put to different ends. While Ackoff’s hierarchy generally has knowledge-as-model, another understanding of model could be <delimited detail='quotation'>“information with practical consequences.”</delimited> This view necessitates filtered information, as information contains elements both with and without practical consequences. By assigning practicality to knowledge, one can relegate the elements of pure-theory without application to information until they are filtered and contextualized by use.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       <section detail='subsection' location='aut:207'>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       <sectionnumber>8.4.3</sectionnumber>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         <sectiontitle>Survey III</sectiontitle>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         <sectioncontent> The participant is a manager of a consumer electronics repair workshop.

 The wording on these strongly suggests a standard hierarchy. Furthermore, the relationships allow transformation: data becomes information becomes knowledge.

 The first quote suggests data are facts, but does not indicate the participant’s understanding of fact. The second quote belies the traditional hierarchy by placing a set of data above information, though the trend of randomness or <delimited detail='quotation'>“lack of structure equals data”</delimited> is still present. Thus, in my analysis, I have to default to the description <delimited detail='quotation'>“statement”</delimited>without further elaboration due to the participant’s answers.

 In keeping with the traditional hierarchy, information is data with structure or data post-analysis. The last quote also implies some hints to information-as-communication as well, though that meaning is overwhelmed by the data-with-analysis usage.
  Knowledge is understanding:

 From these quotes, the participant suggests that analysis of information becomes knowledge. Knowledge as understanding or conclusions does not suggest the use to which that knowledge is put, however.
  This survey presented difficulties due to the fuzziness of the participant’s explanations. While there is some evidence of a standard hierarchy, the relationships between the terms are poorly articulated. Here the survey did not provide enough guidance to extract from the participant their ideas on how data, information, and knowledge relate to one another. At the very least, this survey presents evidence of how deeply Ackoff’s theories have penetrated the <delimited detail='quotation'>“white knowledge”</delimited><link><descriptionsymbol detail='footnote'><m:math><m:mrow><m:mo>*</m:mo></m:mrow></m:math></descriptionsymbol></link> of society.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          <description detail='footnote'>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           <descriptiontag><link><m:math><m:mrow><m:mo>*</m:mo></m:mrow></m:math></link></descriptiontag>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           <descriptioncontent>White knowledge is the everyday knowledge that <delimited detail='quotation'>“everyone knows”</delimited>  but that doesn’t need sourcing or attribution due to its sheer ubiquity and acceptance.

Their self-description of their role emphasized management and planning skills with a correspondingly high information consumption. Participant overwhelmingly classified things as information, with 5 Data, 13 Information, 5 Knowledge, and 3 Other. The use of Other suggests a willingness to differentiate, although it seems that from descriptions of what they wrote, some of the categorizations are in error: a few times participant categorized something as information but explained it as data. Participant differentiates emotion from the traditional hierarchy, as they categorize both mugging and poetry as flows of emotion. There is insufficient evidence to articulate how emotion relates to data. Despite these problems there seems to be some evidence for the traditional hierarchy.

 Data is filtered and structured by knowledge, thereby producing information. The participant understands data as subjective observations, as indicated by the keyword <delimited detail='quotation'>“filter.”</delimited> These observations are filtered and contextualized into information, in keeping with Tuomi’s cyclic hierarchy. This set of responses matches interviews III and IV quite well, suggesting some commonality of background. Most importantly, it suggests that the realities of data explored in those interviews were not flukes, as the <synonym detail='abbreviation' tag='SDFN'>SDFN</synonym> also produced these results.

 However, knowledge is sharable and a way of creating context. The context-creation component of knowledge in many ways suggests Tuomi’s cyclic hierarchy rather than Ackoff’s hierarchy in the way that knowledge plus data create information: <delimited detail='quotation'>“the key is knowledge that once learned creates a new set of filters for Alice to perceive the data through.”</delimited> Knowledge is also a way of generating choice.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               <section detail='subsection' location='aut:211'>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               <sectionnumber>8.4.5</sectionnumber>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 <sectiontitle>Survey V</sectiontitle>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 <sectioncontent> This survey, produced by a research scientist, was incomplete and very terse.

 There is no evidence for any required activity with respect to the observations. The identification of noise as data suggests that there is no intentionality associated with the data. Unlike some of the interviews, wherein data is the product of sensors and experiments, noise as data suggests that data is inherent in the world, and that the observer’s knowledge is what allows for filtering and contextualization into information.
  Information is contextualized data:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  <itemgroup detail='itemize'>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   <item>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     <itemtag><m:math><m:mrow><m:mo>•</m:mo></m:mrow></m:math></itemtag>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     <itemcontent><delimited detail='quotation'>“A collation of data within a context, not just random.”</delimited></itemcontent>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     </item>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   <item>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     <itemtag><m:math><m:mrow><m:mo>•</m:mo></m:mrow></m:math></itemtag>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     <itemcontent><delimited detail='quotation'>“At one level the planning program might be considered to be knowledge in itself.

 Data seems to be a subset of information: structured records containing statements about the world. However, the classification of quizzes as data is strange, although the participant may be responding more to the topic of quizzes than to the entities themselves. Thus, information with structure is data. There are no suggestions as how to utilize either with knowledge.

 In the last two quotes, the participant defines the boundaries of information using the example of the temperature chart for data and <delimited detail='quotation'>“background knowledge”</delimited> for knowl  edge. In many ways, all the examples are simple facts without relationships and the facts are statements about the world.
  Unfortunately, the few answers the participant gave for knowledge do not provide a useful definition:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      <itemgroup detail='itemize'>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       <item>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         <itemtag><m:math><m:mrow><m:mo>•</m:mo></m:mrow></m:math></itemtag>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         <itemcontent><delimited detail='quotation'>“The parts are at different locations.

 While there is a suggestion that knowledge consists of factual or true statements about the world, there is no way to reach that generalization from these responses. Furthermore, as the participant uses the term <delimited detail='quotation'>“fact”</delimited> when describing information, knowledge has to be something beyond simple fact.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       <section detail='subsection' location='aut:213'>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       <sectionnumber>8.4.7</sectionnumber>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         <sectiontitle>Survey VII</sectiontitle>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         <sectioncontent> The participant self-identifies as a corporate strategy manager. They gave balanced categorizations to data, information, and knowledge, with an extraordinary 9 Other versus 5 Data, 6 Information, and 6 Knowledge. They used the Other category to delineate art, wisdom, and lists. Of all of the surveys so far, I am the happiest with this one because the high incidence of Other categories suggests strict definitions for the three categories of interest.

 Data are factual records that cannot contain subjective elements such as impressions or thoughts. Entertainment, as stated before, does not produce data, but the record of someone consuming entertainment is data, because it is an objective fact about their person. Furthermore, all facts must be about activity of some sort. The participant is not  interested in scientific facts per se, but in records of actions that can be contextualized into information and analyzed into knowledge about the target.

 The assessment of the data may be performed by knowledge, but is never explicitly stated as such. If knowledge contextualizes data, then participant is using a cyclic hierarchy, wherein knowledge contextualizes data, which in turn produces information, which can be analyzed to knowledge.

 From an intelligence standpoint, this makes sense: predictions about the world are one of the ultimate intelligence products. Thus, the outcome of knowledge is a prediction. The nature of a prediction differs from the usual knowledge models of data-as-facts constructions. Although the participant indeed considers knowledge to be models, the nature of a prediction is such that it is an exported and actionable model upon which other people can base their activity or lack of activity. Of interest here is the traditional view that enemy actions can communicate volumes about their intelligence sources and models of worlds, as unlikely actions may indicate the presence of a leak in one’s  organization. The ability to make predictions that are given to other people, therefore, is tempered with far more severe complications than physical models of the world.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               <section detail='subsection' location='aut:215'>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               <sectionnumber>8.4.9</sectionnumber>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 <sectiontitle>Survey IX</sectiontitle>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 <sectioncontent> The participant is a housekeeper. In this job, they have a low exposure to workplace- enforced understandings of data. The participant has a very unusual categorization: 7 Data, 5 Information, 4 Knowledge, and 10 Other. The high rate of Other represents a lack of broad categories. In a sense, this represents a lack of formalization from learned patterns.
  The participant makes a brief mention of data as technical-communication. In other words, they consider data-as-bits a separate use of the term data:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  <itemgroup detail='itemize'>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   <item>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     <itemtag><m:math><m:mrow><m:mo>•</m:mo></m:mrow></m:math></itemtag>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     <itemcontent><delimited detail='quotation'>“Computer data-a different use of the same word....

 In this, they also conflate the term with information, which is a common usage. However, this separate meaning should not be confused with a conception of data as data-as-communications. While using data as a term for computer records is certainly possible among all of the three realities of data, those who use it as their primary construction elaborate upon it more; the idea of it being a side definition never really occurs in practice, there usually is a seamless transition in usage depending on context. However, this area is another in which far more research will be needed before it is possible to make any definitive statements, especially the exploration of the use of the two terms, data and information, to mean the same thing.

 Knowledge is transferable, certain, and constructed. The phrase <delimited detail='quotation'>“built-up knowledge”</delimited> suggests a subjective, constructivist view of knowledge.

 While there are strong elements of data as bits, there are also elements of data as observations, which suggests that the participant uses both ideas simultaneously inasmuch as data are stored observations. It seems that collecting data is a database- centric act, i.e., data is something which is stored in a database. There are no semiotic overtones or indications of stored meaning.
  Information is a semiotically significant transfer:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      <itemgroup detail='itemize'>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       <item>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         <itemtag><m:math><m:mrow><m:mo>•</m:mo></m:mrow></m:math></itemtag>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         <itemcontent><delimited detail='quotation'>“A short story is information.

 Although the participant differentiates between information and knowledge, there is the strong suggestion that they are similar. The participant articulates an objectivity-subjectivity spectrum: data being the most objective to knowledge being the most internalized and subjective.
  Knowledge is a framework of learning designed to situate problems:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          <itemgroup detail='itemize'>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           <item>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             <itemtag><m:math><m:mrow><m:mo>•</m:mo></m:mrow></m:math></itemtag>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             <itemcontent><delimited detail='quotation'>“Imagining a scenario where I receive a short technical report to read on the task force. ...

 The act of interpretation indicates that something is knowledge, whereas information is far less subject to interpretation, though there are some suggestions that information is used to build context.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           <section detail='subsection' location='aut:218'>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           <sectionnumber>8.4.12</sectionnumber>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             <sectiontitle>Survey XII</sectiontitle>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             <sectioncontent> The participant is a research engineer who assists with troubleshooting and does basic research.

 There is no need to filter scientific data because they cannot occur without intentional observation and measurements. The duality of data as observations and data is very hard to reconcile. While it seems that data-as-bits is a side definition, there is no evidence to blithely dismiss it. Participant also does not indicate that data are objective, merely that they are specific, intentional observations. This answer illustrates one of the difficulties of the survey: the inability to follow up on interesting leads that are ambiguous.

 Information exists between the abstract generalizations of knowledge and the factual observations of data. This set-based conception resonates with some of the ideas of data sets from the interviews and falls into the same philosophical framework: collections of facts can be analyzed for patterns.
  Knowledge produces highly generalizable concepts about the world:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              <itemgroup detail='itemize'>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               <item>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 <itemtag><m:math><m:mrow><m:mo>•</m:mo></m:mrow></m:math></itemtag>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 <itemcontent><delimited detail='quotation'>“Knowledge because it involves abstract, generalized concepts that presumably have been produced based on previous experience and analysis (data and info).”</delimited></itemcontent>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               </item>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                </itemgroup>
 Knowledge is predicated on both information and data, creating a gradient of specificity. However, as the other descriptions of knowledge were poorly explained, it is difficult to fully generalize knowledge’s relationships with data. However, working from the data-as-facts construction, knowledge must be patterns that provide correct predictions of the world.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               <section detail='subsection' location='aut:219'>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               <sectionnumber>8.4.13</sectionnumber>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 <sectiontitle>Survey XIII</sectiontitle>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 <sectioncontent> The participant is a researcher modeling industrial processes from an engineering perspective.

 All of these data are numerical and contextless. Sound is intrinsically numeric and thus is considered by the participant to be data. They show no evidence, however, for data being anything other than numbers. The use of music/sound rules out measurements as data and there are no suggestions for objectivity.

 Information, as catchall, has a non-standard relationship with knowledge and data. Although there are hints to a hierarchy, there is no discussion of what actually comprises information. From inference, information is contextualized data.
  Knowledge is explanation, chief of a hierarchy of primacy:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  <itemgroup detail='itemize'>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   <item>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     <itemtag><m:math><m:mrow><m:mo>•</m:mo></m:mrow></m:math></itemtag>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     <itemcontent><delimited detail='quotation'>“Depends on quotes: <delimited detail='quote'>‘Day is Hot,’</delimited> then information.

 The contextless aspect is predicted by the information phrasing, but from the second quote, Data is meaningless without said context. Data, without the ability to interpret them or without a use, cannot transmit meaning. The participant may have a constructivist view of knowledge, which suggests that only data contextualized as information have utility. Data as proto-information, therefore, lack utility.
  Information is data with context:

 Context provides meaning to data that support judgments. The process of contextualization is what allows data to become information.
  Knowledge is a judgment:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      <itemgroup detail='itemize'>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       <item>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         <itemtag><m:math><m:mrow><m:mo>•</m:mo></m:mrow></m:math></itemtag>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         <itemcontent><delimited detail='quotation'>“Bob has had to make a judgment on whether this noise is of any interest.”</delimited></itemcontent>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       </item>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        </itemgroup>
 In some ways, the term <delimited detail='quotation'>“judgment”</delimited> is disjointed from the other philosophies of knowledge inasmuch as it combines imagining and predicting the future with then assessing the best outcome.

It would be more revealing if Dave were grading Theses or Dissertations or reviewing Essays or White Papers.”</delimited></itemcontent>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             </item>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           <item>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             <itemtag><m:math><m:mrow><m:mo>•</m:mo></m:mrow></m:math></itemtag>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             <itemcontent><delimited detail='quotation'>“This is data because it does not reveal anything about Dave or his network or his intentions.

 Data are the traditional building blocks of information, though the quotes above suggest that data stems from non-novel revelations. Data are measurable, small, recorded descriptions of the world or target.
  Information is an imprecise statement about the world:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          <itemgroup detail='itemize'>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           <item>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             <itemtag><m:math><m:mrow><m:mo>•</m:mo></m:mrow></m:math></itemtag>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             <itemcontent><delimited detail='quotation'>“This is more than mere data, because we know something about the sender and recipient of the letter.

 The term <delimited detail='quotation'>“more than”</delimited> suggests a traditional hierarchy. However, unlike most hierarchies, information is used to identify statements that do not reveal useful patterns due to their level of detail or other imprecision.
  Knowledge is relationships or patterns:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          <itemgroup detail='itemize'>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           <item>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             <itemtag><m:math><m:mrow><m:mo>•</m:mo></m:mrow></m:math></itemtag>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             <itemcontent><delimited detail='quotation'>“This is knowledge about the two targets within our tracked network, because it defines loosely the roles that the two targets share between each other.

 Knowledge is a pattern or relationship among entities. It allows for understanding and prediction through application of patterns to future events.
  The most important aspect of this survey is that it is completely analyzable according to the very simple analysis methods that this section employs and that it produces no products that would have it be viewed as an outlier. If I were not the one doing the analysis, it would be difficult to write a rubric that would capture the different understanding of instructions sufficiently for the coders to catch it accurately. Future iterations of this research must have more questions and better instructions that can detect this level of wrong model-of-survey in potential participants.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           <section detail='section' location='aut:222'>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           <sectionnumber>8.5</sectionnumber>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             <sectiontitle>Survey Analysis</sectiontitle>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             <sectioncontent> The results from the surveys successfully triangulate my results. While limited by the same potential bias as the interview analysis, the high variation in conceptions of data from the survey suggests that I may very well be on to something. On the other hand, the phrasing of the survey instructions suggests that I may have indicated to my participants what I was looking for, thereby eliminating scientific rigor from my experiment. For this reason, the survey results are presented as a curiosity, rather than as proof of different conceptions of data in the wider world.
  Different roles have different uses for data, and there are differences of opinion as to the methods of knowing, intrinsic nature, and purpose of data. In the surveys, people referred to records, observations, and numbers, roughly mapping to the terms found in the interviews.
  Records, as technologically stored signs, can be data if they are stored properly. Another term for record is row or tuple. These tuples can be about any topic and can suffer from anomalies: authoritative conflicts in which the database may not represent the thing in the universe of discourse. Despite this, to some people, any records in the database are still data.
  Observations are the act of applying consciousness to a reality. They can be subjective and inconsistent. At the same time, researchers used the term to indicate experimental observations that are objective and provide their own context. The term observation in the surveys suffers from the same traps that it does in the interviews and is worth far more research.
  Numbers as data are used by both the database designers and the objective researchers. Numbers are either a more objective refinement of an observation or merely a  semiotic rendering that requires context and analysis to render into meaning. Numbers are the sine qua non<link><descriptionsymbol detail='footnote'><m:math><m:mrow><m:mo>*</m:mo></m:mrow></m:math></descriptionsymbol></link> of measurement, as they are the result and the goal of factual inquiry. Those who believe data are facts can use the idea of numbers to represent this.
  However, numbers are also the without which not of databases, being a different order of thinking about a record. A number in a database sense can be either the content of a record or the sign by which a record is stored, because a series of bits are simply numbers. Both uses are evident and present evidence of a fascinating linguistic trap for future research.
  From the point of view of question of interest 1, the surveys were a complete success: people demonstrated that they had realities of data that departed in ways far beyond mere semantic differences over subjectivity and objectivity. Furthermore, different roles tended to cluster around different understandings of the term, suggesting that educational background combined with the current uses of the term strongly inform meaning. However, from a methodological perspective, the tainting of the surveys with the item of interest leads to results that are strongly suspect. While these results are encouraging, no real conclusions may be drawn from them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               <description detail='footnote'>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               <descriptiontag><link><m:math><m:mrow><m:mo>*</m:mo></m:mrow></m:math></link></descriptiontag>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               <descriptioncontent>Without which not.   </descriptioncontent>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             </description>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             <section detail='chapter' location='aut:224'>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               <sectionnumber>9</sectionnumber>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 <sectiontitle>Different Realities of Data and the Database</sectiontitle>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 <sectioncontent> How can different realities of data can be applied to the philosophical conceptions of the database as corporate memory? Different realities of data provide a novel and interesting context in which to think about corporate databases and database design. To a database, data is an instantiation of a sign. Just as words represent both signs and reality, tuples<link><descriptionsymbol detail='footnote'><m:math><m:mrow><m:mo>*</m:mo></m:mrow></m:math></descriptionsymbol></link>in a database represent signs and the reality behind those signs. When we define data as an instantiated sign, the nature of data in a database becomes very important. Using the communicative definition of data, a database contains a number of signs and the explicitly encoded relationships between the tuples.
  In relational databases, there exist two categories of relationships between tuples. The first, and simplest, is a grouping of tuples into tables. A table exists as a set of identically formatted tuples representing different data of similar type. The second type of relationship between tuples is relationships between tables: while tables group tuples together, tuples can relate to each other based on internal codes or information.
  The combination of these relationships allows for the computer to encode signs as data in the form of tuples and to relate signs to each other, allowing for manipulation of the signs to create new signs, and for information processing to occur outside the brain. In database design, the term <delimited detail='quotation'>“business rule”</delimited><link><descriptionsymbol detail='footnote'><m:math><m:mrow><m:mi>†</m:mi></m:mrow></m:math></descriptionsymbol></link> defines a statement that shapes the nature of the database or the way the database manipulates information.
  From a semiotic perspective, we can interpret these business rules as mental maps: they exist to shape, form, and interpret the data through our understanding of the local                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  <description detail='footnote'>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   <descriptiontag><link><m:math><m:mrow><m:mo>*</m:mo></m:mrow></m:math></link></descriptiontag>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   <descriptioncontent>A tuple is a more formal name for <delimited detail='quotation'>“row”</delimited>  in a database, or a set of data of different domains stored together.</descriptioncontent>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 </description>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 <description detail='footnote'>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   <descriptiontag><link><m:math><m:mrow><m:mi>†</m:mi></m:mrow></m:math></link></descriptiontag>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   <descriptioncontent>A business rule is a constraint or action imposed upon the database by the business reality within which the database is functioning.  </descriptioncontent>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 </description>  reality of business practices and norms. Through business rules interpreting data, the computer can act on the data, pass new data to other business rules, or change the business rules themselves: the exact same relationship that a mental map has with signs in a conscious system, albeit on a much more simplified level.
  The act of designing a database is strongly informed by the designer’s constructions of data. The mapping of relationships and the nature of each table is a reflection on both how the designer understands data and how the designer understands how the ultimate users understand their data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   <section detail='section' location='aut:227'>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   <sectionnumber>9.1</sectionnumber>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     <sectiontitle>Case Study</sectiontitle>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     <sectioncontent> Consider a case of a fictitious winery trying to create a data warehouse. I will use this as a case study in which the ramifications of realities of data are illustrated in this chapter. This case study was developed for a data warehousing course at my old university and is of sufficient complexity to illustrate some of the issues raised in this chapter. <delimited detail='extract'>TigerWine Distributors was founded in 1985 by two college friends, Miss G. and Mr. R. The company was originally based on a small family winery, founded in 1878 and passed down through Miss G’s family, and has since grown into a very successful wine distribution company. Today, the original winery is only a small portion of their business. The California based company now trades as an importer and distributor of wines throughout the United States. Over the years, TigerWine Distributors has built up an extensive portfolio of premium products and represents a large number of national and international wine wholesalers as well as many small vintners.
  One of the greatest strengths of TigerWine Distributors is that it has contacts with the complete spectrum of the wine-sales trade from small, but prestigious, restaurants to the largest liquor stores and supermarkets. Their customers also include private individuals, regional vintners, traditional wholesalers, individual cash-and-carries, specialty stores, and other independent outlets.</delimited>
 This setup is an excellent foil, as the hereditary views of Miss G’s understanding of data as tempered by her university experience could quite plausibly differ from Mr. R’s  understanding, especially if Miss G studied a more scientific viticulture major versus’s R’s business degree. If these managers commission an analytic data warehouse for their distribution business, it is reasonable to suppose that they will understand data in different ways. To these two individuals, we will add a third, a Mrs. B, who is their CTO and the person developing their data warehouse.
  For purposes of this case study, Miss G considers data to be reflections of objective reality, most comfortable manipulating data as observations from chemical studies of grape biology. While she admits that there is business data to be collected and analyzed, the data exist only in sales records: the movement of real things and the income derived from their movement.
  Mr. R considers the most important <delimited detail='quotation'>“data”</delimited> in their records to be the intangibles of customer satisfaction and error rates. He has heard that the data warehouse could explore these questions but is not entirely sure what black magic needs to be applied to the <delimited detail='quotation'>“big data”</delimited> for that exploration to occur. In many ways, Mr. R considers data to be encoded human communications and is interested in how to decode those communications.
  Mrs. B is the CTO, and therefore considers all data to be subjective recorded impressions. While she considers this in her role, she also needs to design the database so it can fulfill the requirements of the other two founders of the company. For purposes of this case study, Mrs. B will be making a data warehouse that only covers the distribution side of the company, and will be trying to understand the realities of data held by the founders.
  Designers can encode business rules in a database in two ways. First, designers can build them into the design of the system, informing the grouping of columns, the design of tables, and the relationship of one table to another. Relationships are a way of encoding the constraints of reality into a constructed simulacrum, a database. A constraint is a  database’s way of enforcing a rule. A relationship between tuples is defined as: <delimited detail='quotation'>“this tuple may not exist without a reference to another extant tuple.”</delimited> This both encodes the specific tuple the entity being created relates to, and enforces articulation of that relationship.
  In the context of TigerWine Distribution, the table business rules look like: <delimited detail='extract'>CASE
  A collection of items offered for sale; this is the fundamental unit of sale for the distribution side of the business. It can be: - a case of wine that is not on a special promotion (case-wine) - a case of wine that is on a special promotion (promotion-case) - a special promotion package that consists of one or more bottles of wine and one or more other items. (promotion-case)</delimited>
 This is a straightforward and unambiguous presentation of what the table contains that would be accepted by any of the realities of data. The practice of the different realities does not rely on the different formulation of specific business rules, but the very choice of specification of the rules.
  Therefore, for purposes of the case study, the question is to illustrate a table or relationship that each of the three understandings would find particularly compelling or distasteful. For data as objective measurements, Miss G would find the presence of a table of written employee evaluations without any real <delimited detail='quotation'>“data”</delimited> to back it up most objectionable. It would illustrate the worst of subjectivity, without even offering the benefits that computerized semantic analysis of a mass of product reviews. The tables she would most approve of would be the automated sensor readings from the distribution warehouses of the stock that was on each shelf. Miss G would also object to normalization because it splits one <delimited detail='quotation'>“observation”</delimited> across multiple tables; as the meta-data for the observation belongs in a different table than the data.
  Mr. R as someone who holds data as subjective observations, is nominally "okay" with <delimited detail='quotation'>“anything”</delimited> in the database, so long as it accurately reflects reality. Mr. R is not  interested in the merits or lack thereof of normalization, so long as the database accurately reflects the subjective impressions of reality that he wants it to encode. In a way, this means that Mr. R treats all entities within the database as <delimited detail='quotation'>“equal data”</delimited> with no one tuple privileged against any other due to its intrinsic truth or relationship to the universe. Mr R especially dislikes tables that are not internally consistent within the rules of the database: just because reality gives people multiple phone numbers does not mean that there should be multiple phone number fields in the <delimited detail='quotation'>“person”</delimited> table, even after the fact. For Mr R, if reality changes, the database should be reengineered to reflect that reality accurately without consideration for the costs or impacts on established software. Without a consistent and useful database structure, the queries to manipulate and transform the presentation of data in the database will fail.
  Mrs. B considers data to be encoded human communications or encoded information. Therefore, the database tables are a repository of human interactions with the world, curated and made searchable by other humans. Any design that interferes with that curation is discouraged, as it makes the task of the maintainer that much more difficult. Because the tables in a database have on ontological value to Mrs B, she is comfortable with whatever arrangement of tables that will work best with the programs that support human communication. Any table arrangement that exists for the data’s sake rather than to support the programs that support human communication is pointless and wasteful effort. For example, normalized relations that introduce inefficiencies for the purpose of avoiding rare or even purely theoretical data anomalies is to be fiercely resisted: it is inefficient and does not serve human communication. Instead, it gets in the way of programmers and therefore makes the encoded data less likely to be presented to the users.
  The other, more significant way, is with queries<link><descriptionsymbol detail='footnote'><m:math><m:mrow><m:mo>*</m:mo></m:mrow></m:math></descriptionsymbol></link>: exposing and relating signs in a predetermined format. The real power of queries, however, is that the data they output can be used as the inputs for subsequent queries: just like a sign or group of signs, one mental model can output data to another mental model for further interpretation. A query draws upon the encoded business rules in the database and applies some criteria to find only interesting entries of interest. These entries can be composed from multiple tables, even positing characteristics not originally planned for in the database but derivable from available evidence.
  The importance of this similarity cannot be understated. When I discuss databases, I am talking about the seat of external memory and cognition for distributed cognition. Whereas other entities shape and perform I/O on the database, as well as on their own interpretation, most of the processing in a database happens through the use of business rules, either as constraints on database design or the implicit contextualization of data via queries.
  Queries with regards to different realities of data, are simply structures to produce the desiderata as a function of expectations of the querent. The actual structure of the query to produce the same information varies little based on the coder’s conception of data, as there are <delimited detail='quotation'>“right”</delimited> and <delimited detail='quotation'>“wrong”</delimited> ways to access information in a database dictated solely by the efficiency of a particular query.
  While there are techno-philosophical approaches on more sophisticated queries with their representation within the database and the methods used to construct them: mainly varying the complexity of individual queries and whether or not they the output is collated within the <delimited detail='quotation'>“host”</delimited> programming language. These choices of programming and                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      <description detail='footnote'>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       <descriptiontag><link><m:math><m:mrow><m:mo>*</m:mo></m:mrow></m:math></link></descriptiontag>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       <descriptioncontent>A query is a way of retrieving sets of tuples from the database.  </descriptioncontent>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     </description>  efficiency are subtly influenced by the realities of data of the programmer.
  Specifically, the choice of whether or not to perform the desired operations within a purely database context or to perform intermediate stages within a programming language can certainly reflect the programmer’s conceptions of the <delimited detail='quotation'>“atomicity”</delimited><link><descriptionsymbol detail='footnote'><m:math><m:mrow><m:mo>*</m:mo></m:mrow></m:math></descriptionsymbol></link> of data. A programmer who views data as non-atomic will be more <delimited detail='quotation'>“comfortable”</delimited> making giant queries as the idea of splitting apart tuples and recombining them in an extended chain does not produce a cognitive dissonance in the programmer’s mind. However, for realities of data that are less about semiotic manipulation and who consider a tuple an observed or recorded fact, intermediate translation stages within the context of a more comfortable functional programming language would necessarily appeal more: there is no violation of objectivity in operating upon retrieved data as contrasted with reformulating the presentation of that retrieved data within the data retrieval system itself.
  Assuming that all three founders are sufficiently comfortable with programming languages and database systems to write queries, we can approach this from their perspective. Miss G, with her reality of data as objective representation, would prefer to retrieve numerical data gathered by automated systems and sensors. She would consider much of the ancillary data in the system to be <delimited detail='quotation'>“metadata”</delimited> supporting the certainty of various conclusions that could possibly be made by manipulating the <delimited detail='quotation'>“true”</delimited> data within the system.
  While she recognizes the existence of text in the database, the presence of the text is considered to be merely a way to inform a website, rather than <delimited detail='quotation'>“data”</delimited> to be collected and analyzed like the data she gets from sensors. Her queries would focus on data retrieval                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      <description detail='footnote'>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       <descriptiontag><link><m:math><m:mrow><m:mo>*</m:mo></m:mrow></m:math></link></descriptiontag>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       <descriptioncontent>Atomicity: whether a given piece of data can be divided into associated attributes  </descriptioncontent>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     </description>  instead of manipulation, and the statistical summation and estimation necessary to make conclusions from the collected data would be performed in a sufficiently powerful mathematical system of her choice. <delimited detail='quotation'>“Tampering”</delimited> with the data through sophisticated SQL queries, especially ones that filter or remove data on anything more than simple <delimited detail='quotation'>“boundary”</delimited> filters (between this time period, from X sensors), would be tantamount to heresy. Removing the atomicity of the tuples in many ways invalidates the objectivity of their storage choices and recording methodologies because it is changing the context after the <delimited detail='quotation'>“experiment”</delimited> (in her eyes) started.
  Mr. R, as a business type, is most interested in tracking consumer sentiment over time. He also sees data as the most ephemeral, human, and subjective. Data are observations, to be sure, but the are human observations. SQL is powerful because it can produce unusual and post de facto relationships through the mechanism of queries. Mr. R is the most comfortable of the three producing <delimited detail='quotation'>“new”</delimited> information through the transformative properties of queries, and sees nothing wrong with encoding a long query that touches many tables to produce a novel and interesting output. In a sense, Mr. R. would like to be able to <delimited detail='quotation'>“persuade”</delimited> the database to produce the results he wants.
  Mr. R is most interested in manipulating and analyzing the text as input in customer and performance reviews. Because nothing in the system is objectively true, the things which are more rich in human meaning, e.g. words, are more useful than the things which require significant statistical analysis to extract meaning from, such as numbers produced via sensor observations. The presence and analysis of the text in the database is an interesting challenge, rather than an irrelevancy.
  Mrs B. is not particularly interested in the analysis of stored data. As all of this is a stored semiotic representation of human information, the primary purpose of the database is to efficiently retrieve wanted records for humans to manipulate without  any incorrect or wasted retrievals. As efficiency of communications is everything and humans are necessary for transforming the data into information, Mrs. B is less interested in automated analysis and complex queries than R or G. However, she recognizes that these tasks are desirable from R and G’s standpoint and will try to design the database accordingly, creating specialized <delimited detail='quotation'>“views”</delimited> (permanent queries which can be treated as tables) to suit both of their requirements. Her queries and manipulations of the database will be designed around efficiency and speed of retrieval and access rather than the semantic content of the data itself.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       <section detail='section' location='aut:230'>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       <sectionnumber>9.2</sectionnumber>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         <sectiontitle>System Models and Mental Maps</sectiontitle>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         <sectioncontent> The semiotic concept of the system model for databases [<link destination='1:Borgman1986' location='1:Borgman1986'>60</link> and <link destination='1:Storey1999' location='1:Storey1999'>61</link>] is the mental map of the designer instantiated in business rules and relationships<link><descriptionsymbol detail='footnote'><m:math><m:mrow><m:mo>*</m:mo></m:mrow></m:math></descriptionsymbol></link>. The mental mapping is the functional product of the user’s internal representations of data. This map is exploring the database designer’s environment, both in the explicit requirements of the system given to him by the consumer and through formal and informal observations of the old system. The designer’s understanding of requirements informs the design and implementation of the intended system model.
  A trivial example of a system model mismatch can be seen in the finite state machines of a typical Sydney mass-transit ride. The correct system model of a typical subway service is that the user starts by purchasing a magnetically encoded ticket, pushes it through the machine at the front, and at the destination. If there are no more uses left on the ticket, the machine captures the ticket.
  However, some users may have an <delimited detail='quotation'>“insert ticket in starting machine, then discard”</delimited>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         <description detail='footnote'>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           <descriptiontag><link><m:math><m:mrow><m:mo>*</m:mo></m:mrow></m:math></link></descriptiontag>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           <descriptioncontent>Relationships are specific business rules that delimit how different tuples can or cannot relate.  </descriptioncontent>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         </description>  model in their heads, leading to problems when the inevitable ticket checks occur on a train. This confusion may be compounded by those stations that are open to the train platforms, because they are too small to justify the staff that ticket-taking stations would require. Thus, the user’s actions with his or her ticket may not correspond to the expected actions by the designers of the ticket system, and from this basis, mistakes occur.
  From the perspectives of the three founders of TigerWine distributors, they have been working together long enough for a shared pidgin to spring up around the database. Just as in the interviews the term <delimited detail='quotation'>“raw data”</delimited> was used, the three founders would evolve similar jargon to map specific concepts within the database to their own internal realities of data. However, at the creation of the database these pieces of jargon would not have yet evolved.
  One of the initial debates the three would have at the creation of the various datamarts supporting the distribution business. As the framing document states: <delimited detail='extract'>TigerWine distribution business has now grown to the point that the partners would like to begin anticipating business trends. They want to be able to predict patterns in wine availability along with trends in wine drinking so that they can dynamically adjust their business to maximize sales. It would be helpful for them to have a data system (warehouse or data mart) that allows them to track changes in the products available from different suppliers, changes in the availability of various categories of wine, and changes in the buying habits of their customers. They would also like to analyze the efficiency of their current business processes, especially their warehouse inventory management.</delimited>
 Miss G would be most interested in the objective and discrete changes in product availability. These are based on objective business measurements that do not require interpretation. As such, the analysis of buying habits is something of an imponderable that is a useful pipe-dream but not discoverable from the <delimited detail='quotation'>“database”</delimited> they have. Data, to her, is a purchase or a price.
  Mr. R is certainly interested in changes in product availability, but inasmuch as that  reflects the intentions of the businesses that they are interacting with. The data warehouse being developed is a way to get inside the minds of people the business interacts with, and therefore Data is a discrete decision recorded by a computer. He would prefer more effort be spent in capturing entered text, as that provides more and better clues as to the decision making process than simple sales numbers.
  Mrs. B is interested in the technical challenges of interpreting these disparate forms of human communication. As the author of the <delimited detail='quotation'>“extract, transform, and load”</delimited> process, Mrs. B. will be responsible for the manipulation and transformation of the various external data sources that the data warehouse will be connected to. For her own use, she is most interested in data that is well documented, as that gives a better understanding of what the human communication is about. This documentation then allows the programs to provide better contextualization of the data for human consumption.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           <section detail='section' location='aut:234'>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           <sectionnumber>9.3</sectionnumber>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             <sectiontitle>The Consequences of Error</sectiontitle>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             <sectioncontent> The system model interprets reality into an abstract model of relationships and norms or business rules. A good system model corresponds well to reality: relationships in the map correlate with reality. The proof of a pudding is in the eating and the proof of a system map is in the using. Systems generate system maps in their user through exposed affordances. If the affordances designed into the user interface correspond with how users think they should behave, the users have a good system map.
  A system model that is poorly envisioned or implemented, either because of design errors or misunderstanding of the user’s realities of data, causes multiple types of potential error [<link destination='1:Codd1990' location='1:Codd1990'>62</link>]: data corruption, data deviation, and misinterpretation. As the system map deviates from reality, the incidence of the three types of error named above becomes ever more likely.
  Data corruption stems from where a system model does not allow or require sufficient updates from systems that observe reality. As parts of the system correspond to earlier realities, they increasingly fail to reflect the current reality. Errors breed. In a system where an interaction produces the right result for the wrong reason, the user does not become aware of their mistake. In fact, a mistake only occurs if there are observed secondary effects that were not desired by the user. However, further interactions may lead these second (and third) order mistakes to create their own changes to the system’s state, turning what was an unnoticeable mistake into something that can bring the entire system to a screeching collapse. An example of such a problem is seen in preventative car maintenance. If a car is improperly maintained, nothing will happen initially. As systems fall out of timing, lose their lubrication, and suffer other failure-of-maintenance effects, these failures cause other systems to break down. These secondary systems may light the <delimited detail='quotation'>“idiot lights”</delimited> in the dashboard, but for a bad driver, it is not until a furious boil of smoke escapes from the engine that they are confronted with their mistake. If those incidental problems are fixed without due thought, the underlying causes will simply cause other systems to fail until the car is written off as a total loss. This unfortunate outcome is purely due to the user’s system model diverging from the car’s reality.
  The second type of error is data deviation. Whereas data corruption stems from data falling out of synchronization with reality, data deviation starts with the data being out of synchronization due to a database design that cannot accurately reflect reality. Incorrect assumptions, norms, or ignorance can lead to data deviation. I can draw a trivial example from a special case of postal mail: <delimited detail='quotation'>“general delivery”</delimited> that may instruct mail to go to a centralized post office to be held for pickup. Corporate database systems may not be designed to recognize general delivery, nor may they have business rules suitable for letters addressed under general delivery notation. Geographic Information  Systems have even had problems mapping other post office special cases (Postal Boxes) to geographic location for purposes of illness tracking [<link destination='1:Hurley2003' location='1:Hurley2003'>63</link>]. These problems are data deviations, in which reality does not conform to the database and errors occur when there is an irreconcilable mismatch.
  Misinterpretation, on the other hand, stems from problems in others’ interpretation of tuples in the database. As the interfaces access the database, the system models of the interface designers may map the meanings of the relationships and the tables in the database incorrectly. This leads to interfaces which present the context of data incorrectly and thereby a cascading failure of meaning which eventually leads to mistake and error.
  Corruption stemming from different realities of data requires more research at this time. My research did not provide sufficient evidence to make useful specific examples of the secondary and tertiary effects described above.
  The data warehouse envisioned by G, R, and B, may experience some deviation. Data deviation would stem from a mis-implemented ETL stage by Mrs. B. In this deviation, if the transformation misunderstands the reliability or meaning of the column being translated, the new column could appear correct in its new context but have its meaning shifted significantly. One probable cause of this error is misunderstood labels for financial transactions, altering the <delimited detail='quotation'>“start and stop”</delimited> time periods of some transaction aggregations.
  Misinterpretation in Mrs B’s data warehouse would stem from Miss G and Mr. R misunderstanding the documentation of the tables. While this looks like data deviation, the error of misunderstanding happens during data consumption rather than data recording and is a function of in-company documentation and communication practices. Because miscommunications occur when the designer fails to express her intentions correctly, it is a discrete category with different failure modes than deviation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               <section detail='section' location='aut:237'>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               <sectionnumber>9.4</sectionnumber>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 <sectiontitle>Database as Corporate Mind</sectiontitle>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 <sectioncontent> It may even be possible to extend the new understandings of the reality of data to an exploration of the philosophy of the corporate mind, for a corporation’s memory is in its databases. Donald Cunningham explains John Deely’s theory of human experience when he states [<link destination='1:Cunningham1992' location='1:Cunningham1992'>64</link>]: <delimited detail='extract'>Umwelt
  model and argues that our cognitive experience is mediated through a labyrinth of signs, a personal world, created by the organism via species-specific sensory characteristics and particular experiences in the physical world. This umwelt comes to define those things that we pay attention to and consider as <delimited detail='quotation'>“real.”</delimited> Humans, uniquely, can create signs that go beyond immediate experience: Words, pictures, bodily movements and the like can become part of our umwelt even though they may mark objects that have no literal basis in the physical world.</delimited>
 This theory of human cognitive experience can be extended to memories. Only that information which is part of the corporate databases can be considered part of a corporation’s umwelt. Although individual agents of a corporation may be aware of reality not otherwise informed by the databases, the corporate entity can only perceive reality through the inputs and outputs of its databases. This important link between the database and reality requires that the database designer’s system model corresponds well with reality to reduce errors in database design.
  A tragic example of the problems of corporate memory occurs in the story of the American MERS Corporation, a tiny corporation that maintains a database of most mortgages held and transferred for securitization [<link destination='1:Smith2011' location='1:Smith2011'>65</link>]. <delimited detail='extract'>The implication is that MERS is superior to the local courthouse system. The evidence is the reverse. Chris Peterson has described the utterly unorthodox corporate governance system of MERS, where employees of other firms put on a MERS hat for a short period as a <delimited detail='quotation'>“MERS certifying officer”</delimited> and execute documents. MERS does not supervise these individuals. Indeed, it specifically disavows any responsibility for the accuracy of MERS’s records: MERS makes no representations or warranties regarding the accuracy or reliability of the information provided. MERS disclaims responsibility or liability for errors, omissions, and the accuracy of any information provided. MERS does not input  any of the information found on the MERS(r) System, but rather the MERS Members have that responsibility regarding mortgage loans in which they hold an interest. ... And there are widespread indications of member non-compliance with MERS processes, such as making assignments without having proper corporate authorization (including out of bankrupt entities). Moreover, the updating of records by MERS members is strictly voluntary.</delimited>
 Thus, banks are using MERS as their memory; they cause it to be a model that reflects their reality. However, they have no obligation to keep the model accurate, and have no recourse or backups when problem arise because MERS is so much more efficient than the traditional paper audit trails. This conflict of priorities produces predictable results: an error-filled foreclosure process with many parties fighting over the reality of possession before courts and the U.S. congress.
  To a corporation, errors in database design allow signs to be encoded into the database that do not correspond to reality. Therefore, the corporation’s actions will deviate from the most optimal, because the corporation is endeavoring to solve a problem that only has a tangential relationship to reality. Poor system models beget worse system models. It is inevitable that database design passes from the initial designer to subsequent designers employed to make changes to the database.
  With a poor system model, only the most glaring of errors advertise that they are errors. Other errors simply alter the corporation’s responses to reality without causing agents to realize that the responses do not perfectly correspond. In the latter case, as secondary designers attempt to change the database to adapt to changing business conditions, the initial system model residing within the designer’s imagination influences all subsequent system models. Without careful consideration and reflection at each stage, the errors induced by the database structure cause the database to diverge further and further from reality.
  In context of the example of TigerWine Distribution, they suffer from a glaring error in their system model: wine is identified by the case, and only with difficulty as individual bottles. Because they associate wine with cases of wine, the most obvious error is that they won’t identify other opportunities to sell bottles or unusual containers of wine. The <delimited detail='quotation'>“with difficulty”</delimited> above indicates that their marketing department forced through a change: promotions could contain bottles of wine as well as unusual items like corkscrews or cheese. This presents a logical disconnect within the database itself: half the company understands wine as something which comes in a case, and the other half understands wine as something that appears inside a pre-packaged promotion. While the humans involved are certainly smart enough to understand the em nature of a case of wine, the fact that these ontological descriptors of containers are hardcoded into the database informs the corporate identification of objects and its behavior towards them. As the technology ages and new systems are built upon the old technology, it is quite possible for these artificial divisions to be encoded in the new systems like unto laws of nature. This subsequent generation is when the <delimited detail='quotation'>“schizophrenia”</delimited> sets into the corporate mind, as the databases state a thing that is simply not true in <delimited detail='quotation'>“reality”</delimited> but fully accepted as true within the corporate memory.
  Fixing errors in a production system is difficult as <delimited detail='quotation'>“the cost of fixing errors grows exponentially as a function of elapsed time to discovery.”</delimited> [<link destination='1:Wand2002' location='1:Wand2002'>66</link>] Since these errors exist in a production system that has run for some time, the cost of fixing the errors is prohibitive at the stage when the errors are found. The only way to insure that the system model of the database designers keeps the system in line with reality is to inspect the database and insure that it corresponds with reality within the required specifications.
  By understanding the impact the various users’ realities of data has on a database and on corporate memory, this philosophy of corporate mind combined with an under  standing of how we conceive of data can provide tools for a data modeler to create better databases. Normal database modeling methods are quite formalized, exploring the relationship of tuples to each other and whether or not to split them into new tables. Other database design methods simply instantiate the tables of a <delimited detail='quotation'>“default”</delimited> database and allow the designer to connect new tables and data structures to the pre-extant core<link><descriptionsymbol detail='footnote'><m:math><m:mrow><m:mo>*</m:mo></m:mrow></m:math></descriptionsymbol></link>. In many ways, most database-creation methodologies already expect the designer to understand the participants’ realities.
  When teaching database design, I had students create data-flow diagrams mapping the current reality. They then updated the <synonym detail='abbreviation' tag='DFD'>DFD</synonym>’s so that they could reflect some sort of more coherent <delimited detail='quotation'>“future reality”</delimited> and created the database design from that. The process of updating designs from current reality to future reality was never explicitly spelled out, merely left as a <delimited detail='quotation'>“well, you should solve this yourself”</delimited> method for the students. An understanding of the various realities of data, and especially of how different people understand data, may provide for better database design.
  An understanding of data will provide for better design neither by increasing normalization<link><descriptionsymbol detail='footnote'><m:math><m:mrow><m:mi>†</m:mi></m:mrow></m:math></descriptionsymbol></link> nor by providing better requirements-collection methods. Instead, the discussion of realities of data will provide for better design by giving the practitioner more tools to understand the clients’ requirements. Although this will not help with those clients who insist on a turnkey design, the understanding of the different realities will help render what the clients think is data into the database, including elements of data that are not currently present in the artifacts<link><descriptionsymbol detail='footnote'><m:math><m:mrow><m:mi>‡</m:mi></m:mrow></m:math></descriptionsymbol></link> inspected by the

users perceive the nature of data. In a more limited sense, I wanted to demonstrate that users have different conceptions of data and a method for discovering hints as to how they use and understand data. In that light, I have been successful. This research should serve as the foundation to more specific and focused studies into the different social constructions of data present in our societies and what epistemological and ontological basis data may have.
  With the use of the term “raw data” there is some evidence for trading zones being established as people with different usages of data must discuss it to function in the same way. In a more limited sense, this evidence may just be an artifact of the narrowness of the study. Either way, more indication into the establishment of trading zones with different technological concepts is strongly indicated.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       <section detail='section' location='aut:245'>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       <sectionnumber>10.1</sectionnumber>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         <sectiontitle>Results</sectiontitle>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         <sectioncontent> People have different realities of data. My methods are capable of generally distinguishing between different realities. I have found three distinct realities: data as communications, data as subjective observations, and data as objective facts.
  In the data-as-communications category, users generally consider data to be electronically encoded semiotic representations, or bits stored on a computer. Although some people in this category believe that data are any communications (i.e., data are signs), most believe that data are re-encoded and computerized signs. This construction tends to share some space with the other understandings in the sense that people can use the term <delimited detail='quotation'>“data”</delimited> in an electronic sense when referring to <delimited detail='quotation'>“computer data”</delimited> and in  the <delimited detail='quotation'>“proper”</delimited> sense of facts or observations. However, even in that case, there is more a blending of the two meanings rather than two distinct meanings.
  There are people who classify data as observations. Observations, in this case, are any acts in which a sensor (such as the brain and eye) takes note of the world. These observations are then filtered according to some knowledge and situated with context as information. All observations are data, but not all data is important. Only data situated properly in the correct context can be assessed for utility.
  Considering data-as-facts, people equate facts with objective, true, statements about the world, and comprehend data as small facts about specific parts of the world. Facts are a superset of data, information, or knowledge, being objective and truthful statements about the world regardless of scope. People in this category tend to favor strongly objectivist views of science and tend to be scientists and some types of engineers. Data as facts does not require external context, and is packed with its own meta-data: its precision, provenance, reliability, and reproducibility, among other things. Data as facts strongly tend to be numbers.
  It is clear from the, admittedly biased, results of the surveys that many other variations exist on these three simple categories. These findings are in no way exhaustive, merely suggestive of what I found in the majority of my interviews and surveys. It is obvious to me that far more research is necessary before any definitive statements can be made about the different realities of data present and, especially, their possible interactions and failure modes with each other.
  The Social Data Flow Network has great utility as an reality-discovery methodology. The <synonym detail='abbreviation' tag='SDFN'>SDFN</synonym>, inspired by the data flow diagram methodology of systems design, is quite able to cause participants to differentiate between practical definitions and theoretical definitions when discussing a participant’s construction of data. And is therefore better  than more focused requirements gathering methodologies at this task.
  The <synonym detail='abbreviation' tag='SDFN'>SDFN</synonym> produced many useful discussions of data, causing participants to reflect on their own working definitions and on how they contrast with formal or intuitive definitions. The propensity for generating self-reflection is a useful product of the iterative categorization of the <synonym detail='abbreviation' tag='SDFN'>SDFN</synonym>. This process of iterative categorization provides mechanisms for inspecting peoples’ functioning definitions, rather than the theoretical definitions under discussion.
  The internal consistency of the results between the analysis of the transcript and the analysis of the diagrams suggests that the generation of the <synonym detail='abbreviation' tag='SDFN'>SDFN</synonym> diagrams provides a useful triangulation method for both reflection during the interview and subsequent analysis. However, the <synonym detail='abbreviation' tag='SDFN'>SDFN</synonym> requires significant refinement: it must be made less intimidating; steps must be made+}

With this research, I hope to encourage philosophical thinking in those areas and to demonstrate that many worthwhile philosophical activities must be rooted in a firm knowledge of their respective areas.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  <description detail='footnote'>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   <descriptiontag><link><m:math><m:mrow><m:mo>*</m:mo></m:mrow></m:math></link></descriptiontag>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   <descriptioncontent>Our philosophers of technology+}

The count should be the same for the entity on paper and the entity rendered in the computer-based visualization. This practice is more effective than counting every edge in the diagram at one time because when the count is off, it is easier to figure out what edge is missing, but faster than comparing edge by edge.-] {+person’s self-worth [<link destination='1:Leary2005' location='1:Leary2005'>54</link> ].+}
