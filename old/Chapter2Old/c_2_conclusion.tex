This research investigates the philosophy of data, because there is no clear consensus on the exact nature of data, much less on the exact nature of data in technical design. However, as there is no recognized domain of the philosophy of data, this research, as a more practical matter, must lay the simplest foundations for this multidisciplinary field. 

My basic discoveries, both methodological and philosophical, should have pragmatic results. I hope to create a methodology that improves communication and database design. I not only need to demonstrate the foundations of the philosophy of data, but to demonstrate that I have an \XPhi\ methodology capable of discovering philosophies of data. 

I explore how we socially construct and use the term \quotation{data}. From this invesitgation, I can offer potential insights into how we create trading zones between different cultures of data use. While true understanding of the nature of data may be outside the scope of this present research, the construction of a foundation is not. Any methodology created must be robust enough to provide useful observations and a compelling story.
